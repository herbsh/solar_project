0,1,494,"The so called ""Solar Assisted Air Conditioning"" from SEDNA AIRE or SOLAR COOL doesn't deiver the saving promised and on top of the low performance, the company fails to honor the warranty in a responsible and timely manner. Do not buy this products, save yourself headaches.",1,0.4939
1,2,556,"My take on solar installers is that they should be evaluated like any other contractor you hire. Did the installer  provide you with relevant information, did they arrive punctually for on-site visits, and to perform the work? Did they follow up after the work was completed? Did thy present you with any unpleasant surprises?

Measured by these standards, SolarFlair did an excellent job. SolarFlair's employees always arrived punctually, and were courteous and knowledgeable. They handled all of the necessary paperwork, including registering the system to qualify for SRECs. The installation went flawlessly:  work on the system was completed over two days, as promised. SolarFlair followed up post-installation as well to make sure that I was satisfied with the operation of my system.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this installer.",5,0.7351

We just had a solar system installed by Capital Cities Solar as part of new construction on our home.  The cost was 27.3K net for 32 solar panels.  It was a clean install, the new panels look great and the system is cranking out electricity beyond expectations.  Brian in sales and Erin in operations handled all the lease paperwork with Sunpower and connection with PG&E.  I now just watch the meter run backwards.  I highly recommend Capital Cities Solar for your solar needs.

We received quotes from other suppliers but we felt that Exact Solar gave us the best value.  More importantly, they gave us the true story, not just a salesman song and dance.

I would highly recommend them.  ",5,0.872

6,7,20196,We have been very pleased with Casey's solar hot water and heating installation at our house. He had done this type of installation before and showed us how we could incorporate our solar hot water into our heating system. We opted for the evacuated tube-type heating elements vs. flat panel (more expensive but more efficient). We would definitely recommend Casey to others interested in installing a solar hot water system.,5,0.7845
7,8,20195,"We were Steve Keyes' first PV installation. It all went very smoothly. There were a few very minor glitches on the paperwork end (submitting documentation to the State), but the actual installation and operation has been essentially problem-free. Our only complaint is that we did not have more roofspace to put more panels on!! We recommended Steve to a number of people in our Town and he has completed installations at three of those homes.

During the three months that the system has been in place, my electricity bills have added up to a total of MINUS $45.  It's too early to say for sure whether the system will generate slightly more electricity than I use over the course of the year as promised, but, so far, it's delivered the anticipated savings. 

Real Goods also took care of all the paper work and remains in touch to make sure everything is going well.  (As a bonus, I was given a $500 Amazon card.)  I'm very pleased.",5,0.765

11,12,554,"We contracted with SGE because their sales guy, Dave Simmer, was extremely knowledgable. I had done a good deal of research, but still had some questions and he was able to answer them all, as well as to give us some good advice about sizing the system. They were at parity for pricing with our other top choice, Independent Power Systems, but Dave had a slight edge in his industry knowledge.

The installation happened sooner than they had expected - some clearances came faster than predicted, and the panels arrived sooner - so we had the system up and running about two weeks earlier than we had initially thought.

We're expecting to produce nearly twice what we consumed last year, but we've also bought a Nissan Leaf to suck down most of that excess, truly driving that one with zero emissions. We're also considering moving to electric hot water. If you actually produce more than you consume over the long haul, while you build up a credit balance on your bill the power company is not required to pay you that money, so it is wisest to be very close to net zero for the year.

You can see photos and read more on this blog: http://fletchersolar.blogspot.com/

The only negative on the installation is that the monitoring was not correctly installed initially so the electrician had to come back and troubleshoot them, which it appears he did correctly. He was extremely competent with regard to the basic installation, and his workmanship was exemplary. I can only fault him for not having deep understanding of the monitoring systems. There are two monitors, by the way, something called the ""L-Gate"", which is a utility-grade remote metering system that SGE uses to measure production for SREC calculations, and a split production/consumption system from SunPower that lets you see the breakout on the web.",5,0.8151

23,24,20348,"Under Rob's oversight, the LuxLight team recently completed a 25 panel installation at my home in Orange County, CA.  I appreciated Rob's no-pressure, no-nonsense approach that was a stark and pleasant contrast to the larger installers that I spoke with before I found LuxLight via EnergySage.  EnergySage was especially helpful in helping me see the advantage of going with a smaller, local installer instead of the big guys who don’t seem to be interested in using their economies of scale to drive down purchase cost for the homeowner (This was a surprise to me!).  

Throughout the process, Rob was extremely informative and patient,  despite my frequent questions, requests and follow-ups [I'm an Engineer :) ].  Rob's knowledge and experience in the solar industry from both the consumer and utility installation perspective was quickly apparent.  My installation was not a straightforward one and involved several different surfaces and angles;  I wanted to maximize system production while limiting panel placement to areas that would not be visible from the front of the house.   Rob explained the benefits of a micro-inverter install and why it would deliver better results for my situation.   None of the other installers even mentioned the benefits or disadvantages of central vs. micro.

Luxlight pricing was extremely competitive and it was far better than the quotes received from large installers that seemed far more interested in leasing and purchase agreements.  

The Luxlight install was scheduled in a timely manner and despite several obstacles, was completed in a way that met or exceeded all design objectives. The work took about a week; The Luxlight installers left the worksite spotless at the end of each day, with all trash thrown away and equipment neatly placed out of the way.  During the install, I especially appreciated that Rob was onsite and worked directly with the local planning dept (at the city offices) to alter the panel layout when unexpected challenges were encountered.  I also appreciated that Rob stood by the original design/contract and did not try to negotiate a change order to address some of the unexpected adjustments that made the install more difficult and time consuming.  During the install, the Luxlight install team was kind, courteous and responsive to questions and requests.

LuxLight is a small outfit and it is clear that they take pride in what they do.  If shiny trucks with snappy logos and employees with fancy uniforms are important to you, I would look elsewhere.  But if you are looking for a solid installation, at a fair price, backed by someone with 10+ years in the solar industry whose team takes personal pride in their work, I would definitely talk to LuxLight.  My system has been running for 5 days now, with daily production exceeding EPBB Aug estimates by almost 20%.",5,0.8921

While designing our system they laid out various equipment choices and let us customize our system to fit our needs; we went with SolarEdge optimizers, a great technology to maximize power from every panel. The installers were thorough and friendly, explaining to us every step of process, taking photos of the work in progress, and once it was installed teaching us exactly how the system operates.

EIS crews were extremely professional, friendly, clearly had extensive knowledge of both proper installation practices and solar energy in general. Entire staff, from top management to crew, were always available to answer questions, educate us, and check in with us repeatedly in the few months after completion of installation. Even now, if we have a question, we find that the response time either by email  or phone is quick and informative. We've had no problem with the system which has supplied all of our electrical needs for at least 6 months out of the year, and we would recommend EIS to anyone considering solar. In case you're wondering, we have NOT received any recompense in any way for this review. By the way, employment practices of companies with which we do business are important to us.

It was not until I met up with EIS at the Pittsburgh Home Show in 2014 that I explored the concept.  Right at the show using Google Earth they confirmed I had some good ""solar real estate"". Over the next month we communicated via email and their sales person, Ian Smith, provided me with a couple of preliminary options. I had Ian come out to the house where he went up on the roof and made several measurements.  Turns out we were able to have a 7.4 KW 27 panel array with microinverters (to address shading issues with my chimney) installed for less than what a new compact car would cost. I was sold on the spot and we toasted the deal with some of my homemade wine! At that point EIS took control and handled everything including the difficult permitting process. It could not have been easier.  They were very transparent and kept me abreast with everything going on. EIS had everything ready to go by mid April and their crew had the whole system installed, up and running, in a day and a half. It was a beautiful sunny day and my electric meter was spinning like crazy...backwards! My system has operated flawlessly ever since. Over the summer I banked 1400KW that I have been drawing down over the winter.  I believe that my entire electrical needs will be met, exactly as planned.

55,59,20122,"If you ever wondered how your solar system is doing on a daily basis, the Solar Edge monitoring dashboard will provide you with that information.   Once you connect you local Solar Edge controller to your LAN, the system will report operational data to the Solar Edge ""cloud"".  You can then connect to the remote web interface and get data in graphical format on your daily, weekly, monthly and yearly energy production, you can compare it month to month, quarter to quarter or year to year

Another nice feature is the ability to see how each one of the installed panels is performing and compare them one to another.  Should any of the panels develop a problem, you will notice is on the dashboard and alert your installer to it.

The configuration is very easy, requires you to provide just the normal IP information to the controller, everything else (connection to the ""cloud"" and reporting) is automatic and behind the scenes.  I started seeing data within about 10 minutes of completing the connection.

I love the ease of use and the simplicity of the installation.",5,0.7717

There was contractor #3 & #4.  But #5 was the best.  He was the only one to actually get on my steep roof and take measurements.  And when the price came in at $5.00 per watt, I was sold.  That solar consultants company left town about one year later and now he works for EIS.  EIS installed my 2nd solar system, an 11KW ground mount array at a cost of $4.00 watt and they did an excellent job.  I know a number of solar homeowners who are satisfied EIS customers and if you check out their website you can see that they have completed an impressive number of solar installations.

He explained all the factors that influenced the plan, showed us the cool device that maps the sun exposure, but most important, figured out a way to get extra panels onto the roof by moving the hot water tubes to the far side of the roof, but mounting them above it, increasing our kw by about 10%. His approach to the installation itself was equally as focused on quality. When he had a choice, he always took the way that might have required more effort on his part, but that resulted in a better outcome. Plus, his installation was very neat and workmanlike, and he gave us all the supporting paperwork for reference. Last, whenever we have a question, he responds immediately.

60,64,6515,"I contacted several solar install firms to investigate solar power for my home. Few even had the professional dedication to respond.  Most were outrageously priced. Frankly, it is hard to find a decent guide on what to even ask about this market.  Lease? Buy? Is it KWh or kwh? Is that rated for AC or DC? And wtf is net metering? Frankly, I was a bit lost (and I'm probably not alone). 

I spoke with 5 different firms and found only one, Circular Energy, that was able to not only answer the questions, but also help educate me so I could ask even more questions.  Their sales person, Walter Rumpf, was simply great to deal with.  

The Dallas crew was just getting integrated into Circular.  It wasn't a perfect process (no big investment ever really seems to be), but Walter and Kelsey were there to streamline, clean up, and help herd the cats so we could get the project complete.

66,70,20161,"I met Anil a few years before there were state and federal financial benefits. After a brief explanation to let me know what was involved to install solar at my home, he suggested I wait a few years so that I could benefit from rebates and federal tax exemptions that he thought were coming. I was surprised that he basically was open for business but considerate of the best financial solution for me. He was willing to walk away from business at that time, in order for me to wait for a better time for me. 

For him, with or without state and federal benefits for me, he would still do the same work and earn the same money. In fact, to take advantage of the state and federal benefits, required him to do more work and fill out more paperwork to benefit me. So years before I actually did the install, Anil earned my great respect.

When I finally contracted with Anil to install my 10K system a few years later, he explained the process in fine detail which I appreciated. He did what he said he would do, and kept me informed every step of the way. The day my children and I turned the solar 'on' was a very exciting day for all of us. Anil comes back every now again to see how things are running (and they are running well) and to inspect the panels. His contract also guaranteed more years of his personal service compared to other solar contractors.

I was also concerned with having something to supply the one horse power well pump so water would always be available.-, even if the main generator wasn't running at the time.

I contacted Joe Ordia almost by chance, and he gave me an estimate within my budget. We contracted for the installation, and as promised, he appeared promptly on the appointed day and began work.

The DC to AC transformer work, switching unit, and electrical panel install was accomplished by a local electrician that works with Joe as well as having his own business. 

Joe came when appointed, worked steadily, cleaned up after work was accomplished, and returned whenever I asked questions or didn't understand the proper employment of solar power and the battery banks involved.

71,75,20145,"I've had such a fabulous experience with this company, that I want to pass the information along to you in the event you are considering buying or leasing a solar system from the guy in Home Depot, Lowes, or the guy that left the business card in your mailbox. 

People that know me, know that I am a demanding client and a relentless researcher. Generally speaking, solar power does not make economic sense, except when the government is picking up 2/3 of the cost...then it might make enormous sense. I did a tremendous amount of research prior to deciding to invest in a solar array, and then again when deciding on an installer. Ecomen is a family owned and operated firm. 

Ecomen completed my installation NINE WEEKS from when I signed on the dotted line !. The guys from Home Depot told me it would take at least 6-8 months, and two of my neighbors that had solar installed already waited at least that long. The neighbor just east of me came out and looked on in awe as he saw the crew putting up my panels. He signed up way before me and still has no clue when his installation will be completed. For me, time was of the essence since I wanted the tax credit for last tax year. Ecomen promised and delivered. 

As important as the speed of installation is the personal attention and communication provided by Ecomen. They kept me up to speed literally every step of the way and responded to my numerous emails within 24 hours...usually much quicker...nights and weekends included. 

I am not necessarily advocating for solar. Its a personal decision. However if you, like me, are through with ever increasing electicity bills I urge you to consider it since, as stated, the state and federal government collectively are picking up about 2/3 of the cost which in my view makes it a no brainer. What I really wanted to share with you all was the excellent service I got from Ecomen, and to urge you to check them out if you are considering a solar array. ",5,0.7322

I can pay this off monthly, and when it is time to sell my house and retire, I will pay it off entirely.

77,81,20573,"After a fairly exhaustive research of Solar Installers I selected American Solar for my residential solar system. This was based on company reviews and some very professional sales support from Nate. 
Overall, I am very pleased with the 33 panel system from a production performance point of view. 
The issue, which speaks volumes of the true measure of a company, is the follow-up service after the sale and installation...In my case, I had reported that during the installation, one of the crew members apparently  stepped on my interior ceiling sheet rock as he was running conduit and wire from the panels to the inverter in the attic, resulting in a two foot long crack that clearly went all the way thru the sheet rock and was a visible eyesore in my family room area. 
After several weeks of attempts to get the crack repaired, I finally was informed that a sheet rock repair person would be sent out. The morning that individual was to show up, Buddy the project supervisor showed up instead and informed me that the sheet rock guy had cancelled due to a hiring dispute with American Solar. Buddy then proceeded to attempt the repair himself, but we both agreed that the damaged area needed to be cut out and replaced which he was not able to do. At that point Buddy indicated he would get someone scheduled the following week to complete the repair work. That commitment was made in December 2014, and now mid February 2015, the repair still has not been completed despite numerous follow-up attempts on my part to get American Solar to make good on their commitments.

79,83,20507,"We are happy with the panels we installed and with the service we received from Solar Energy. But if you are looking for a perfect contractor in this field you are not going to find one. If you want to know would we choose Solar Energy again, the answer is definitely yes. So this review should be seen as very positive in context. 
Of all the firms we worked with, Solar Energy of Illinois was the best and the easiest to work with. To begin with, it was very hard to get anyone else to give us a quote. The communication by the folks running the City of Chicago's group buy was abysmal. That made it impossible for us to work with them or determine whether they were trustworthy. The availability and helpfulness of James Lampasona, our Solar Energy salesperson, won us over in the end. He didn't pressure us and he answered every question we had when we asked it. 
Once we had gone through all the paperwork--and there is a lot of it! the installation was quick and unobtrusive and there were no hitches in the process. James was willing to come over numerous times to help with completing forms and he remains easily available and willing to help now months after the panels were installed. 
Having said that, there are two things we wish were a little different. First, we had a great quote from Solar Energy--about $1000 less than the City of Chicago group buy. It wasn't till shortly before installation that we discovered that while Solar Energy was offering us top of the line US made panels, they were going to install a less than ideal inverter (not the top of the line Enphase micro-inverters which invert each panel separately so there is no loss of power from partially shaded arrays). We discovered this through a conversation with Juhl Solar--an official contractor for the City of Chicago's group buy--when we were comparing bids and they asked us exactly what our equipment was. James immediately offered to change the bid for another $1,000 to get the Enphase inverters. In the end, Solar Energy cost us the same as the Chicago group buy for a more or less identical system. So no harm no foul, but we would have ended up producing less power with the original inverters and we weren't savvy enough to know the difference. 
Second, after installation, we discovered that Integrys (our electric provider) had not carried out some orders for us and we were not being net metetred. We are not sure we were compensated for the tiny bit of power we generated from Nov. - Jan.  A matter of perhaps $30. We had to discover that error ourselves and it was only luck that allowed me to find it before we lost a lot of revenue. A suggestion for Solar Energy in future deals is to follow up to make sure that power is actually being metered and the whole billing part is working out.",4,0.8442

100,104,20955," I definitely recommend these guys for solar panel installations. For the installation at my house in the early fall of 2014, I've queried and compared several contractors, including the nationally known installers. (I think I generally compare at least 3 ~ 5, if not more, contractors before hiring one.)
Bottom line is that not only did 21st Century provide better deal and better hardware, but after conducting some due diligence, I believe these guys were most trustworthy.  Unlike the other installers (including some that had very good rating on other forums such as Angie's list), I felt that these guys weren't out to just make some quick buck. For instance, other installers will do anything if it means you are spending more money. At least one of the other contractors even made promises which I actually knew they wouldn't be able to deliver on.  Also, all the other contractors ""recommended"" certain equipment based on their ""opinion.""  But in those instances, I learned that their ""opinion"" = ""$ interest"" because those installers were also equipment sales guys ... so if I used their ""recommended"" equipment, they made money on not just the labor on installation, but also on the equipment.  However, it was clear that 21st Century had no such conflict of interest.  They would install pretty much anything I bought ... except that they'd provide me their opinion.  In one instance, Rob at 21st Century actually made me think twice about a set up that would've been less cost effective for me even though it would've meant more $$ for 21st Century.
Having actually hired and worked with several contractors on a few big projects before, I knew that it's a rare thing ... a contractor who cares about the customers' best interest.  Also, I appreciated their flexibility and promptness. The installation guys seemed like a nice crew.

But getting the system communicating properly with the energy company (NStar) and with Solrenview and Mass-cec for SREC credits has been more problematic. In fact my system was on the roof, approved and ready to produce by the end of June 2014. I think that finally at the end of March my first SREC is in the system and ready to pay as of July 2015.
There were times when I asked the correct questions (why don't I see a carryforward credit on my NStar bill when the system produces more than I am using) and was told it was ok and would show up when I started using more than was produced. It did not. But two months had gone by and we figured out that NStar had not properly processed the paperwork. NStar made the mistake but Revision did not follow up on my questions. In the end I got the credit but it required monitoring, multiple emails and phone calls. Likewise Solrenview was not set up properly and months later we discovered that Revision had not installed the correct meter to report generation.

We had one delay with a wrong-sized rack that was incorrectly sent by the manufacturer - but Transformations kept me in the loop and that's all I could ask for.

The best part is that the system is performing beyond/over estimates.  I had a few quirky urban/multi-unit building requirements. I had no space for a centralized inverter in the basement. I needed to do a direct connect to external meter outside of my building. Transformations came through with a perfect solution using Enphase microinverters.

My goal was get the most possible PV output from my roof square footage. This meant they built my system for overall maximum output not on a single panel basis.  So my panels don't tilt too much because it would shade other panels.  Less tilt, more panels on the roof, more output overall!

Where most of the other providers seemed more interested in selling a particular product they specialized in, or pressuring us to go with a more costly overall project, Ross was straightforward with what he saw our needs were.  In fact, he went out of his way to make sure that we were not going to over spend on any of the aspects of installing a solar system (in some instances without us specifically asking)!  

I will also say that this was a very customer oriented process that Ross and his team provided us.  We were never pressured to hurry up and make any decision.  We looked into several different options in terms of panel and inverter manufacturers, and he was always happy to oblige us with new cost estimates.  In addition, he did not inundate my wife and I with follow up calls and emails on an hourly basis like some of the other providers we contacted.

127,131,3296,"I installed a 442SR from Xzeres 4 years ago.   The wind generator came with a 5 year warranty.  Living in a remote area of Colorado, it was/is important to me to have a reliable/dependable source of alternative energy.  We chose the 442 in the belief that the product was reliable and that the Company, Xzeres, would stand behind the 442.  Both of our beliefs were gravely misplaced.  The four years since installation have been an absolute nightmare.  The last time our 442 worked was early spring of 2014.  We finally got a technician from Xzeres to come out to the field in October, 2014.  He determined that internal parts in the generator needed to be replaced and that he would be “back in two weeks” to repair.  He finally came out the week of May 11, 2015, a full 7 months later.  After reviewing the installation, he determined that he did not have the right parts and would be “back in 2 weeks.”  Guess what,  2 weeks have come and gone and he still hasn't come out.  Now he is saying another technician will come but can't give us a date.  

Please understand, we have documented a four year history of dealings with Xzeres. My installation contractor, who has been a life-saver, estimates that during the last 4 years, the generator has only been operational for 12 of the last 48 months.  I personally believe it is somewhat less than that. I want to warn others against dealing with Xzeres. I would hate for others to spend as much as I have and receive a defective product and deal with an unprofessional, uncooperative company.

132,136,20712,"I stumbled on EnergySage, for which I thank thank my lucky stars, because it led me to Gr8 Energy.

This was one of the easiest project/major purchases I'd ever experienced.  Working with Gr8 Energy is like buying car through Fleet as opposed to haggling and dealing with the sales games of the regular car sales department.  I had solar installed on our house at the same time or a little after a bunch of my friends got solar for their homes (and I would've recommended Gr8 Energy to them if they lived in SoCal), and my experience was so different from theirs that they're jealous.  

I dealt primarily with Ross as my contact person.  We first spent about 2 weeks emailing about what system I should get for my house.  His opening suggestion was a smaller system than we'd wanted (I'd forgotten to tell him we want to eventually trade in our ICE cars for EVs), using a string inverter when we wanted the new-fangled microinverters (which cost more and most companies try to upsell to that right away), so I knew right off the bat that Ross was trying to figure out what we NEEDED as opposed to what he could get out of us.  He priced the system reasonably, made the changes I requested (bigger panels!  more panels!  microinverters!), and got me the proposal back within a day.  BTW, I know the website states their work hours, but I've gotten quick email responses from Ross late evenings, on weekends, early mornings.  Late in the planning stage, I changed my mind and went with his original suggestion of a string inverter based on the fact that all the panels are able to fit on one plane on our roof, string inverters are more market-proven, it has a hefty warranty, it costs less, and the particular system Ross recommended gives us a designated outlet for electricity use even when The Grid goes down in a power outage (our neighborhood had a power outage during the planning stages of our solar project and my husband freaked out about his salt water tank fish dying from the pumps stopping).  I told my friends about this feature, and they'd never even heard of it and now they regret some of their decisions.  So Ross amended the proposal and modified our system once again, into a beefed-up version of the one he'd recommended to begin with.  I felt a little sheepish about that, and he proved himself the expert, but the entire time, he was really, really nice about all my back-and-forths on decisions and didn't give me any problems nor delays whatsoever.

So, 2 weeks for me to figure out what I want and commit to a proposal.  Then Gr8 Energy did all the permits, got approvals from the City for the project, opened up the net metering request from SoCal Edison (SCE), all of which took maybe a few days, but less than a week.  My HOA gave approval to the project based on Gr8 Energy's written plans in a week.  Then Gr8 Energy immediately went to work and built and installed my system in TWO DAYS.  The third day, someone from Gr8 Energy came by only to meet with the city inspector, who praised their work, signed off on it, and contacted SCE to give them the green light.  It took SCE another 4 weeks to give us the permission to operate (PTO).  

My friends' installers took an average of 1-2 weeks for installation, they had to wait a month or more to schedule the install, after waiting a few weeks to months for the panels to arrive.  AND...they paid more than I did for the same products.  Whereas for me, I gave Ross my bottom line on pricing, he accepted, and all his proposals have respected that price point, with some proposals (since I made him go through so many re-do's) coming in well under the price point.  That's another reason I knew I wasn't going to be ripped off, on top of the fact that all his emails were very clear, thorough, no-nonsense, patiently answering all my questions and concerns.  I never felt like I was being schmoozed by a salesman.  I had a friend start his solar project a month before we did, and ours was completed a month before his was.  (I only gloated a little, since he was already in agony over our price difference for similar systems.)

Ross's helpfulness did not end at at the completion of the solar installation.  I've emailed him multiple times SINCE his job was done, for little things like, ""How long is SCE going to take to give us PTO?""  ""Is that humming from the inverter unit normal?""  ""What was the performance warranty on the panels again?""  ""How come it's been rainy since our solar installation went up?"" and he has responded to every single email with the same efficiency, patience and informative nature of his previous emails.  Whenever Tesla gets their home battery released on the open market, I'm calling Gr8 Energy back.

151,155,1397,"Not sure if I just had bad luck or this is the beginning of downward spiral on what was once a good company.  Short version:  READ EVERYTHING THEY SEND YOU VERY CLOSELY especially before signing.  
It's crazy but this is the brief version. We were interested in solar and they were one of the companies that friends recommended and they were referred thru energy sage too.  First sales person came out and we really liked him.  They weren't the cheapest but with something that's going to be a 25 year relationship, cheapest isn't the object. Then when we started to move forward things got very slimy very quickly.  He'd send me emails with proposed system specs and costs in the text of the email but then the formal proposal would be different.  Different system output, different design, different cost.  Thought we'd worked it out but then the official sign here contract had something different again. Final straw for me so I moved on to our second choice vendor.  They came out for a site assessment and found that our home actually wasn't going to be good for solar.  Too many big trees.  Not a terrible problem to have but disappointing. Second company said they didn't want to move forward because they didn't feel like we would end up happy with the output or the cost. So, now we think well maybe that's why Native came so highly recommend, they can do things others can't.  Back to slimy sales guy but now, per Longhorn's recommendation, I'd like confirmation for the AE person about the system design.  Now I get a lot about how great Native is and that won't be necessary.  Trust us.  Okay, don't know about you but that really sets off alarm bells for me.  I request a different sales person.  Who knows, maybe this guy and I just aren't compatible.  Then nothing for like two weeks until out of the blue I get a call from someone with the company asking how things are going. Is it that you really don't know the answer to that question or are you trying to gloss things over?  Turns out so-and-so is no longer with the company.  They are terribly sorry and are going to do what it takes to ""make things right"".  Next day I get a call from sales person number two.  She doesn't seem to have any information about my situation other then she's supposed to fix it.  And she assures me she's going to do that.  Now I'm a little optimistic again, these things happen. Companies can have problems with individual employees. But then I get a proposal from her. She's ""upgraded"" me to a micro inverter system.  So in fact the other guy was likely going to sell me a giant paperweight for my roof. The output is less and the cost is more.  Oh and the proposal lists 14 panels and 11 inverters.  I'm no solar expert but seems like those numbers need to be the same.  She confirms yes they do and kindly sends me another proposal with an even higher price fixing her incorrect count and a note about being out of town for the next week so we'll talk later.  Also there was a 1.74% discount to show their concern for my two months of headache.  Now I'm furious.  My reply is there needs to be a big discount or we're done.  Unfortunately some companies only respond when it's about money.  Here's the part that takes the cake.  She again assures me that they care and things will be okay, they have this great new product that I will really be pleased with.  But she tells me she needs me to get approval from their preferred financing company before she can really get things worked out.  I do that, then let her know I won't be going with Dividend Solar financing because their interest rate is 2% over Velocity.  She says that's fine, with a little bit of a tone, then proceeds to send me a proposal that costs even more per kW then the previous proposal even with their ""knock out incentive""!  Really you just tried to upsell me?!?!?
It's disappointing because we really wanted solar but beware there are companies that will prey on that.  Also, if you move forward with these guys see if you can find out who assumes the liability for the installers they use?  They use a third party they are very close with but I couldn't ever get a straight answer what would happen if one of them fell off my roof.",1,-0.5994

Separately, Sean, I believe at the young age of 26, is very knowledgeable about what he does…..furthermore he has a talent for explaining in layman’s terms what he is doing, why he is doing it, and how it works.

Some eliminated on type of panel we preferred and others simply because of cost too high.
We got down to two bidders and Sustainable stayed with us the whole time, patiently answering our seemingly endless stream of questions and not once saying a negative word about other companies (a  practice other bidders should have followed!)
From designing, refining, installation to follow up after wards, a very smooth and positive experience for us.   Everyone was easy to work with; gladly answered our questions; kept us informed as to install schedule; and promptly responded to follow up issues to reach swift resolution.

Based on what I had heard from friends who had installed solar at their homes, I anticipated a complex and long installation process. AWS defied that expectation with timely on-site inspection, rapid scheduling, swift execution of the installation, and (most impressive to me) seamless handling of the city and utility paperwork. The installation team is friendly and efficient. There was very little effort on my behalf, aside from writing a check, of course.

The pricing was better than the competition and they deliver more current products with the goal of replacing our total electrical consumption.  Other companies merely committed to reducing the bill, not replacing it.

The install crew was timely, thorough and left the job site in good shape.  Very experienced installers and electricians.  The system looks great and they accommodated some requests for placement of the inverter gracefully.  SolarUnion also handled the permit process in my notoriously finicky city without a hitch.

Since installation they have been proactive in monitoring the system and reached out promptly when a minor tuning issue arose.  It was promptly and satisfactorily resolved.

I'm an engineer and so was quite interested in the details of the equipment proposal.  SolarUnion provided more of that information up front and the components they selected are very good, yet reasonably priced.  My friends who work in large scale solar unions responded favorably to my description of the system and the pricing.

That was done after I reviewed his business badly both in Google and Facebook and sent a complaint to FTC. Not sure why this person tells you he is working on the order and does not call Velux, but you can see he has done it repeatedly (9 complaints on BBB for solar lighting of Virginia, the owner of skylightdeals.com).

We were time crunched as we had started the process in late March, and I really wanted a system installed before we get to the peak generation months of May-August. 

Within a week or so of accepting their bid for the project, SolarUnion was onsite starting on the installation. Their contractor was polite, clean and very communicative throughout the process which took 3 days to finish. 

My new Trina panels on a 4.5KW system at my residence in Sunnyvale, CA look great and the install process went on smoothly. We have had about 6 months of good production, and consistent power generation, and I would definitely recommend other folks use SolarUnion for their solar needs.

The only thing I had to pick on, if anything, was that they took 3 days instead of the originally estimated 1.5 days to wrap things up, which was actually due to minor modifications requested by the city inspector.

227,231,21242,"I just got my system completed from Altair Solar.  The inspector just finalized everything and I'm already generating sweet solar fuel :)  It feels so good to not be giving all that cash to SCE.  

I did a lot of research when it came to getting solar at my house.  I started like most do, looking at the big names like Solar City, Sungevity, and Sun Run.  I got quotes from all of them, they all had one thing in common, aggressive salespeople and they all wanted to sell me a lease.  This was obvious because their cash quotes were crazy high.  I needed more information.

Being new to solar, and extremely curious about everything and being a big nerd, I bought the Solar Electricity Handbook from Amazon and read it cover to cover.  After reading it, I learned the difference between a microinverter vs. central inverters and other technical jargon.  I also went on Solar Panel Talk's online forum and learned from the people there and shared my different quotes.  They were very helpful.  

Ok, now that I knew what I was getting into, I decided to get quotes from local installers who were experienced contractors.  I got 3 quotes, and I narrowed it down to Altair for a few reasons.  First and foremost it seemed like Khaled from Altair was the most trustworthy out of them. I have had my share of nightmares from contractors in the past and didn't want a repeat of one of those situations.  I have a pretty good ""Larry David"" radar for that sort of thing by now.  Second, he really knew what he was talking about.  Even with the recent knowledge that I had ascertained from the book I read and the forum, and my technical background, I was able to talk shop with the different contractors and could weed out their experience level.  Third, Altair gave me a very competitive quote for the system that I was looking for.

I finalized on a 41 panel, 280 watt mono black Solarworld system with m250 microinverters.  11,480 total Wp total.  

I finalized the contract with them and then went on vacation, scheduling them to come out when I returned.  By the time I got back, he had already pulled the appropriate permits.  The day I got back, he had all of the panels, microinverters, and equipment delivered to my garage and they started work.  I have concrete tiles so they had to be careful up on my roof.  Breakage is inevitable with these installs, but they were able to replace anything they had broken with new tiles.  Within a few days they had the rails installed properly on my roof with panels gleaming in the sun ready to accept solar goodness.  

After they routed the conduits and hooked up to my panel, we were ready to turn it on and test.  It worked!  They installed a monitoring device from Enphase that allowed me to see on the web or on an app my daily and hourly generation.  On the first sunny day I was already generating 60 kilowatt-hours!  He told me I still needed to trim a tree or two to get optimum results because there was some shading during parts of the day, after which he said I'd get even more generation.  It's only spring!

Anyhoo, I'd completely recommend Altair if you are going solar.",5,0.8274

Anyone into solar panels, this is the future!).  They also worked around our schedule and was able to complete the job very quickly.

Sometimes you are understandably hesitant when you have a salesperson telling you about the benefits of something new, but I knew the roof of my house was ideal for supporting solar panels. I was happy though that the engineers did a full evaluation to be sure before I signed on.

 

IGS Solar assembled a great team for the installation of the solar panels and all the electrical work. Both teams of contractors were very professional and had great management. They took my schedule into consideration and worked with me to find a time convenient for me. I also felt I could reach out to them and IGS at any time with questions or concerns—and I did!

 

Everyone on the IGS Solar team was very responsive. They also took into consideration the aesthetics of the equipment which was important to me. One aspect of IGS Solar I like is being able to sign my own Power Purchase Agreement. Some companies sell solar panels and charge for the installation. With IGS Solar I had no upfront costs and immediately reaped the benefits of collecting solar energy.

 

There is no way I would have been able to pay thousands of dollars to purchase and install solar panels. I also don’t have to worry about the maintenance of the panels because IGS takes care of that and all the monitoring for me, including sending me monthly reports on how much solar energy is produced.

 

I was given the go ahead by the power company for my system to go online on April 2nd and am happy to say that for the last two months I have not had to pay the power company for electricity and I continue to add on kWh credits to my bill. In fact, my monthly charge for solar has been less expensive than paying the power company my budget billing amount each month.

Great Sky, being employee-owned and a social-benefit company, has been straightforward throughout, explaining how their (very good) deal differs from other companies', and showing me exactly what to expect both in terms of energy savings and finances.  We had questions about my installation because my roof is flat, and I wanted to avoid piercing the roof if at all possible  Their thorough, knowledgeable staff worked with me every step of the way to make sure that my system will be both efficient and safe. They have been respectful and responsive.  I am totally confident--having done my research--that I got a great deal, a safe and high-quality installation, and excellent support for the life of my system.

We were very surprised at the level of expertise and quality of service that the company brought with them. They helped do a rate analysis to save us more money on our electric bill, custom designed a carport to fit our specific needs that didn't clash with our residence and spent time and money making sure our system was installed and maintained very well.

It's been a year since BES installed our system and we had one service call, some of the wiring was mounted to the panel clips which weren't designed for it, they came out and replaced the clips with permanent mounting brackets, they even gave us a complimentary panel cleaning.

Because of the high cost of those early modules, and my moving a number of times since then, I was unable to justify owning one. I finally moved back to RI, bought a house with great solar access, and happened on SunWatt Solar at a local farmer's market last fall. The SunWatt representative was knowledgeable, open, and inviting enough to convince me to ask for a proposal. After interviewing a number of other PV companies, I chose SunWatt to install a 7KW system on my house. The installation was done in July of this year, and the entire project was completed in less than 5 days. The system went on line on August 3, 2015, and has been working flawlessly since.

263,267,20364,"Out of 6 companies and bids Solora stood head and shoulders above the rest.  Their BBB rating is also the highest possible.  Solora was most professional and knowledgeable by far.  (2 of the other companies were notably unprofessional - one even refusing to give their bid in writing - the other calling with a whining sob story after being eliminated.)  At no point did Solora criticize or adversely comment on any of their competition - even when asked (a couple of other companies did).  Solora was also the most honest and while absolutely not skimping on equipment or quality,  did not try to push their own agenda or any unnecessary equipment in any way.  They did not try to influence us with irrelevant ""free gift"" offers  like some.  (One tried to offer a ""free"" cruise which would eventually of course have cost several times what it's supposed value was.)  Everything down to explanation and samples of tax forms, etc. were clear and detailed.  Their proposal bid was by far the most thorough (and 12 pages long).  Solora's energy efficiency and return on investment calculations and estimates were thorough, detailed and a little more conservative than any of the others (a couple of which were a little too optimistic).  (The system is exceeding the estimates.)  It was the only one that listed make and model of every piece of equipment.  Being an Engineer by profession I asked some difficult questions - they answered immediately and backed up with datasheets and worksheets.  Even one of the inspectors commented on their technical knowledge and expertise. The difference between Solora and others was so marked that we had decided they would probably get the job before even receiving their bid.  It also turned out to be the best price and best customized to our needs.  The work was completed and the system operating a little over three weeks from accepting the bid - less than some wanted just to order equipment.  Solar handled everything including permits and inspections and all necessary paperwork prepared and submitted for us, we did not have to lift a finger.  They gave us hands on user training and a  comprehensive customized owners manual that included all equipment documents, prefiled warranties and samples of tax and WA State incentive forms already filled out for us.

268,272,20712,"Solar power is not necessarily for everyone, but for a majority of us it makes perfect sense.  The four part process of solar should be determining, comparing, installing and on-line.  Determining if you need solar is a process that one has to look at in regards to current electric bills vs. usage, how long you will be at your residence, etc.  This initial step should always be referred back to throughout the entire process.  The comparing process is ultimately critical.  Ever vendor will have a different angle and each interview is a learning process.  Do not make a decision in the early stages.  This is one time that a minimum of 4 to 5 comparisons are needed.  GR8 energy stood out in this category as Rick would promptly answer follow-up questions, yet he would not apply the pressure for a decision.  Suggestions and modifications were made along the way and Rick put my needs first.

We decided on GR8 energy based on the following areas that they scored the highest in.  First the price was the most competitive even though I had decided on TWO SMA inverters and a panel upgrade.  Second, time-wise, GR8 was the most flexible in conforming their schedule to my schedule.  I wanted to be there for a majority of the install, although it was not necessary.
The install process, with Ebert and Enrique actually added value to the project.  They were helpful and their installation was top-notch.  From the quality of their equipment they brought to the site, cleaning up every day, wearing safety equipment was without question among the best as they had a significant level of experience to bring to the job-site.
There were some minor paperwork issues with Edison, but Grace handled those promptly and the PTO (Permission-to-Operate) was issued December 1st.  The system so far has worked impeccably.  I still haven't tried the emergency plugs that the SMA inverters have, but one should give that option a serious look for at least the ability to charge cell phones, laptops etc in a system wide utility failure.

Jim also made himself available to be called anytime I had a question about the process, I even called at 10pm at night on a Sunday and he was very professional and responsive. 

My actual installation was really great the only issue is waiting on the utility but that's not the company fault.  Once approval can in the installation crew immediately went to work.  The crew was great, they also answered any questions I had. My entire 18kw system was installed within a week and I am very pleased with it.

The company electrician was one of the hardest working  and most polite person I have ever had working for me. He kept me informed as to everything he was doing and consulted me several times during installation concerning where to place equipment and electrical lines. 

Service with company has been outstanding. About a month after system was turned on an electrical meter that was installed malfunctioned (meter was still working, but digital readout was not displaying information). After call was placed to company a new meter was ordered and installed promptly and without hassle.

(regarding rebate and tax incentives). It all worked seamlessly and for me smoothly. I scrutinized this company as I had other companies and checked out the reputation in particular. I inquired about the background and history of both the company and of my contact persons while in the company's building 
and while time spent on telephone with them. The dedication and enthusiasm was obvious immediately.  Their smiles in knowing, simply the product and the projection of their steadfast own belief, their knowing. I understood, I got it and I knew with absolute certainty the truth.

In my signing this deal, my inverter and panels are guaranteed for 25 years!  THAT stands on its own.

We decided we wanted to buy our system rather than lease it, and we wanted high quality components but not necessarily the most expensive.  We also liked the idea of going with a local company rather than a national chain.  Out of all the sales people we spoke with, we liked Barrett Silver from SunBlue the best.  He took the time to explain things in detail and answer all our questions completely.  Unlike some other sales representatives, we felt confident in his integrity, and he didn't try to pressure us to make a sale.  SunBlue used only high quality components (LG 300 panels, SMA inverters, Unirac's SolarMount system) and came in at a price we thought was reasonable.  Their system should supply 104% of our annual electricity needs.  Our SMA inverters came with the option of a secure power supply in case of the grid going down, and SunBlue offered to put the secure power supply outlet in the upstairs room where we work on our computers. Permitting with NYSERDA and the town (Greenburgh, NY) went more quickly then we anticipated.  The team that did the survey and installation work was friendly and professional.  They came when they said they would, and cleaned up after themselves.  There were some small unanticipated problems during the process -- because of the town electrical code requirements, the inverters couldn't be placed where we originally thought they would go in our garage, and instead ended up mounted outside the back of the house.  This meant more extensive wiring than anticipated to get the secure power outlet where we wanted it to be.  The installation team communicated well with us around these problems, invited our input, and came up with solutions that completely satisfied us. ConEd swapped out our meter and the town completed its inspections faster than we thought they would, and we are now up and running.  Electrical production is what they predicted it would be.  Our panels are warranted for 25 years, our inverters and mounting system for 10 years, and SunBlue warrantees all their work for 5 years.  Barrett Silver visited us once again when all the work was complete to answer any of our remaining questions and get our feedback about the process.

Our installation was unusual because we wanted a modest battery backup system together with the connection to PGE. They had done full battery systems and full PGE systems before, but not the combination. This led to a few teething problems in their wiring, and as they learned what to do about them they were up front about explaining what the problems were and what they were doing.

We live in Melrose, MA, and were one of EthoSolar's first installations in the Boston North Shore area (we connected with them through EnergySage).  Their mechanical and electrical installation crews did a high quality installation job:  looks great and there was no collateral damage to our home during the work.  We had a little delay commissioning the system (due to our local electrical inspector retiring and handing off duties mid-project), but once we were up and running it has been all on auto-pilot.  EthoSolar comes by the house periodically to inspect the system and we have not yet experienced any problems.

EthoSolar did all the work turn-key:  design, permitting, installation, application for all rebates/credits, etc.  They gave us an excellent reference for a brokerage firm to handle our SREC's (solar renewable energy credits), and those checks have been coming in like clockwork.  It has been a breeze, from the ownership perspective.  The Internet monitoring of the system is also great for watching your daily (or hourly) generation performance; you can watch how you are doing while away on vacation.

Our system was sized to provide about 80% of our annual usage.  In the first year we generated about 115% of the expected capacity; about 90% of our usage, and we didn't have to pay an electrical bill from April 2015 until January 2016!

Obviously price will be a major consideration, but it seems that this company will be around to take of you for a while and if the prices are close, this may be the choice.

378,382,20699,"A friend of mine used EnergyONE to install solar panels on his house, and he was very impressed with the people at the company. He even began doing some design work for them. After talking with him, I felt comfortable that I would be dealing with a good company that would treat me right. We talked about what I wanted, and my friend personally prepared two different design options. I chose the larger option, and my friend submitted the plans and got everything rolling. Unfortunately my friend was new and unfamiliar with company processes, so when my friend submitted the plan, he filed both plans, which caused confusion throughout the process.

After getting the plans submitted, there was the normal paperwork followed by waiting for approval from the power company. After waiting a month, the power company approved the plans, but I noticed at that time that the approval was for the smaller design. EnergyONE indicated that they knew someone who worked at the power company who could possibly fix the situation without having to redo everything. Some phone calls were made, and the plans were updated with only a minor delay.

Shortly after that, EnergyONE called me and told me that the licensed engineer they were using only had a Missouri license, and I live on the Kansas side. EnergyONE told me that the engineer would have to wait a month to get his Kansas license, and there wasn't any other licensed engineer who could do the job sooner. I was very frustrated, because I felt like this was something they should have known about at the beginning of the project. To their credit, EnergyONE found an engineer with a Kansas license to do the job, and paid extra out of their pocket to have him sign off on my plans. It was the first of several occasions when EnergyONE did something extra to fix a problem.

After getting the plans signed off, installation commenced. At this point I was watching, and unfortunately my suspicions came true. The workers installed the old, smaller design instead of the larger one. At this point, I was REALLY angry! I could understand clerical errors that resulted in the initial first submission being incorrect, but I couldn't understand why the incorrect plans were still floating around by the time installation occurred. After some emails and phone calls, EnergyONE arranged to have additional panels installed by the end of the next couple of business days. Even though this is probably a mistake that shouldn't have happened, the end result didn't create a significant delay.

Unfortunately, the electrician who did the work for EnergyONE failed to get the appropriate permits from the city. (EnergyONE now checks on permits before paying subcontractors.) As a result, the power company refused to do anything, and the explanation for the holdup was very unclear. I emailed and called the power company myself until I found someone to explain things. I was unhappy with EnergyONE, and I let them know how I felt.

Then the CEO and I had a frank discussion. EnergyONE is a smaller, tightknit organization. The CEO is passionate about what his company does, and he genuinely wants his customers to be happy. It's personal for him, and this attitude is reflected in the company. EnergyONE proceeded to get the appropriate permits as quickly as possible, in many cases calling the city every day to check on progress. Things got done much faster thanks to their persistent calls. In addition, EnergyONE reimbursed me for the lost electricity generation during that time.

When things go well, it's easy for a company to claim that they put customers first. The real test is when issues arise. What does a company do then? EnergyONE really works hard to put customers first. Mistakes were made, some by my friend who was just trying to be helpful. EnergyONE did everything possible to make things right. I would definitely recommend EnergyONE, because most of the time things go smoothly (like they did for my friend), but if there is a problem, they will do everything possible to make it right (like they did for me).",5,0.836

NESGS was knowledgeable, accommodating, and professional in every sense at every step in the process.

From our perspective, the project overall took about 1 year:  two months' researching and contacting prospective installers on our part, two months' collaborating and posing questions with NESGS after choosing them, two months' waiting for various approvals from WMECO (aka Eversource), two weeks' installation following approvals, one month waiting for final go-live approval from utility company, two weeks' tweaking the live system for optimal performance, four months' waiting for registration with the agency which will manage our SRECs.  The majority of the time in our project was spent either researching, or waiting for approvals from authorities.  The shortest amount of time was spent on installation and performance tuning.

Once, I decided to proceed AJ took the reins and off we went.  It was frustrating at times due to the regulations and the need to deal with the electric company, Eversource in this case, but AJ was there to assure me that in due time my solar array would be up and running and producing power.

He was right, it took time but once the array went online we started to see  the value of what was to come. Mind you the date our system went online wasn't the most optimal (October 27th) but our electric bill was still at least half of what it normally was each month since.  I am confident that once we go through the spring and summer months we will have built up enough credits with the power we produce to not have ANY electric bill again.

SRECs were another category that I was unfamiliar with but again AJ was there to explain and assure.

From start to finish we were given all the information needed to assure success. Based on their solar estimate, we decided to take down a chimney we weren't using and one large tree.

True South Solar staff also explained all the tax advantages in detail as part of the estimating process, and provided us with all the necessary documents to qualify for the Energy Trust of Oregon rebate as well as for the federal and state tax credits. Three sets of inspectors came out to review their completed work: City of Medford, Pacific Power, Energy Trust. They all said almost exactly the same thing as soon as they saw the True South stickers, ""These folks make our job easy."" They left all smiles, finding no problems.

There was a small discrepancy when we asked our tax preparer to estimate the tax impact. On further review, she discovered True South was right––and that our project had educated her on how the federal law works. True South really knows their stuff!

We are in mid-February now and have acquired a Prius Plug-In, which has a range of 12 miles when used in pure EV mode. We plug it in nightly. Even so, with our day-time solar charging, our power bill is lower than ever. As one might expect, gasoline fill-ups are few and far between as almost all our local miles are EV only––fueled by our solar panels.

The sun is still low in the sky, but our 18 high-efficiency panels already have produced peak hours of 4.5kW generation during the brightest days of early February. Although government lab ratings are rarely met in the real world, our system rated at 5.88kW is designed to exceed our present annual need as we plan to add air conditioning and anticipate even longer range batteries for our Prius will soon come available.

Our solar panels are built on an extremely durable solid copper base. They have record-setting efficiency, and are manufactured by SunPower, a US-based company, which offers the best warranty in the business. They are warranteed for 25 years and designed for 40 years' service.

We feel our future looks bright! Indeed, the only potential downside we can see for others considering solar is that we are currently in an election year. Congress has approved the Federal solar tax credit only through the end of 2016. Nobody knows whether that credit will be dropped or extended for work completed after the 2016 tax year.

439,443,20030,"The short review: 
The panels are great, they are extremely responsive to my questions, they were willing to work with me and still return my calls quickly after getting my money. However the process took 4 months and required several nasty emails on my part to get things done.

Long review:
I was looking to have solar panels and an electric car charger installed last year before my second daughter was born in October, but after we sold a condo and got the cash for the installation. After getting some quotes Solar Union had the best price, was the most attentive was willing to work with my timeline and alternative payment schedule, which was awesome.

I called a previous customer and he told me that his recommendation was to have my contract say that if there was a new electric panel or new wiring required as part of the solar installation process, it was going to be Solar Union's cost. That advice probably saved me hundreds, if not thousands of dollars!

I signed my contract in July, and they started the initial design process while we waited to get money for the next steps in August. We had someone come out to see the house so they could draw up plans, and then a week or two later a different guy came to meet an inspector for an initial site inspection. At that initial inspection, the man from Solar Union had not brought a ladder so the inspection had to be rescheduled. The rep from Solar Union seemed very pissy about this and was frankly pretty rude to the inspector.

At the rescheduled inspection a third Solar Union rep came out (he ended up being the head of installation), but our inspector was extremely confused because the plans were drawn up for a different kind of construction that was not relevant to our property. So they needed to draw up new plans and do the initial site inspection again (for those keeping track this is now 3 inspections without anything being done on the house). At both the second and third inspection the inspector was very clear that we would need a bigger, higher wattage electric panel to get the installation approved.

Once we got the money and clearance to start work, we were told by different people in the company that the panels were either in storage, on their way, or hadn't been ordered yet. This lasted for several weeks.

Once installation started, the installers installed a new panel, but one that was the same wattage just larger. They got the panels on and the car charger installed over the course of about a week, but as you could guess the inspector came back and said the panel was too small. So they installed a new one that was THE SAME WATTAGE. Again, the inspector came back and told them it was too small.

At this point it was October, after signing the contract in July, and I was due with my baby.

Two days after coming home from the hospital I had installers here for THREE MORE DAYS installing a larger wattage panel and a larger service connection to the PG&E wires. Then it took another week or two to actually connect to PG&E. So my panels were turned on at the end of October, and I was connected to PG&E in November.

I was put on the wrong PG&E rate, and not told anything about those, but it has all been figured out now and the panels seem to be performing very well.

Overall it was EXTREMELY frustrating and if I didn't work from home the 8 inspections would have been terrible to deal with. However the price was great, the communication is actually great and the panels are working well. Just buyer beware.

445,449,21389,"Panelman Solar review: 
When I first was interested in residential solar power I read everything I could find trying to wrap my head around how it works. With the federal and state tax credits paying for 55% it was a no brainer. Then I contacted several companies for information, layout, feasibility, and cost quote. Jamie Eden ,owner of Panelman Solar, not only answered all my questions and explained the process but gave a quote that couldn’t be matched by the other solar installers. His knowledge of electrical systems and the fact he uses German solar panels instead of Chinese panels put Panelman Solar on the top of the list for me. Most companies use unverified Chinese panels. Solar is a big investment, so I was very nervous because I didn’t know anyone else who had installed it. Panelman solar was in constant contact with me, which if you ever used a contractor, getting a hold of them can be the most frustrating part. 
After a few weeks of weighing my options I decided to go with Panelman Solar, and I feel I made the right decision. Solar technology has improved recently with more efficient panels, inverter, and power optimizers. The other solar companies were using micro inverters and Chinese panels which in my opinion is old technology and less efficient. Panelman ran solar sun software to see where my panels would best be placed and how much energy I can expect to generate. I then had to decide which layout looks best and how big a system I wanted to install. Given that the tax credits pay for 55% I wanted a system that could offset all my electrical cost. My roof size and orientation made it possible for me to install a 7.1kw system. 
So my first step was to make sure I had enough tax liability to get the solar energy credit, I did and got all 55% back. Then I went to the bank and got a HELOC loan that I could pay back in around 5 years, and made the payment the same as my SCE&G electrical payment that the solar panels would offset. 
Panelman solar then ordered all the panels and equipment and within a couple of weeks I had the panels installed on my roof. Panelman solar was on top of all the permits and bureaucracy you deal with when getting city inspector’s to approve system. Within two weeks of the installation SCE&G had replaced my meter with a bi-directional meter and I was selling electricity back to SCE&G at a higher cost than they charge for it. 
It rained every day the week i got my system, but the first partly sunny day I was connected I made 31kwh in generated electricity and only used 15kw. So I sold back 16kw at higher price than I paid for the 15kw I bought to run my house that day. This was in January so I didn’t have many solar peak hours, but was still surprised about how much I produced. Of course, in the summer I will use way more electricity, but will have many more peak sun hours to produce. Since the sun doesn’t shine every day you have to think about solar as an average kilowatt hour per day produced. The first full month of producing I made 647kw, and that was with really bad weather. I am three weeks into my second month and making more electricity than we even expected. I have made up to 39kw in one day (February) and have almost surpassed last months energy. My house faces almost west so I didn't expect to be generating so much. I had a credit on my bill the first month, and it was a lousy month for sun so I can only see this getting better. 
 The solar equipment Panelman installed sends real time updates to your phone or computer, giving me access to kilowatts produced at any given time. It is great software to see production and diagnose a problem with a panel, if that arises. I can see how much every panel is producing at any time with the solaredge software. 
I couldn’t be happier with the decision I made to get solar through Panelman Solar. So, now I am reducing CO2 emission, earning money by not paying SCE&G’s ever rising electrical cost, and when system is paid off in a few years I will be making money. In roughly 5 weeks the solaredge software says i have saved 1831lbs CO2, planted 47 trees, and produced enough electricity to power 3655 light bulbs for a day. 
The owner Jamie Eden was extremely intent on giving me a system that fit my budget and electrical needs, and making sure I was satisfied with all aspects of the installation and post installation. The other companies I got quotes from are not really local companies and that is what I like about Panelman Solar. The owner Jamie Eden is a native Charlestonian and if I need him I can go to his house and find him, I like that. I would definitely recommend Panelman solar to anyone interested in going solar.

It’s working as planned. Ours is a mostly electric home (though we also heat with a wood stove in winter). Our electric bills since commissioning the PV system are about $100 each less than the same months the previous year.

We’re looking forward to watching our solar returns mount as spring turns to summer, with longer days and higher sun elevation. We’re on time-of-day usage plan with our Piedmont EMC electric co-op, meaning we pay a penalty for power used during peak load times, but a lot less the rest of the time. In cold months, peak load is 6 to 10 a.m. – a time of very little solar generation. In warm months, however, it’s 1 to 6 p.m. And that’s also when our PV system will generate peak power, routinely reversing our meter. So the best is yet to come.

We expect the payback on this system to be 10 to 11 years, followed by 10 to 15 years of escalating cost savings on our utility bills.

Ally modified the proposal, was clear in cost changes and their implications, and kept things moving. In fact, to allow most prompt installation, they kept us ahead of a big job on their books that would have delayed by a month, and instead installed while we were on vacation - all possible because the installation work is external.

465,469,20712,"My wife and I used EnergySage to obtain multiple quotes for a solar project for our home.  After reviewing eight contractor’s bids we selected GR8 Energy.  We liked GR8 Energy’s profile and they were also the lowest price.  I contacted Ross, the owner of GR8 Energy to start the process.  Ross was great to work with and he took the time to educate me on how the system would work and interface with the electric company and what to expect during each phase of project.  Selecting GR8 Energy turned out to be a great decision!   It was amazing how fast our solar project was completed with the installation of a 13.23 kW system comprised of 42 solar panels. We signed with GR8 Energy on the 7th of March and had Permission to Operate (PTO) from SDG&E on the 21st of March.  GR8 Energy’s team was well coordinated and worked quickly to develop the design, generate the drawings and obtain the permit.  At the same time, Grace, from GR8 Energy, moved quickly to facilitate our SDG&E Net Metering (NEM) agreement and the installation of an SDG&E Renewable Meter Adapter (RMA).  Our dream team installers, Herbert, Marco and Enrique did an expert installation.  The installers were very professional and knowledgeable and took the time to answer all questions.  Our new solar system looks GREAT, and is performing at a high level as promised.  My wife and I could not be happier with our experience with this outstanding solar company.  If you are looking to install solar, we highly recommend GR8 Energy as a company you can trust to do as they promise.  ",5,0.9379

468,472,20614,"I represent the Good Business Enforcement Agency. We are a world wide organization that rates and reviews businesses based on pricing, customer service, honesty/accountability and over all attitude. 

The person I spent most of my time ordering with is Bhavesh. I also got help from Corey, Josh, quishaun(spelling?) and a few others.


Bhavesh was excellent to work with. He went above and beyond to ensure I purchased the correct solar panel system. He even went out of his way to research my specific van. He also recapped our conversation and everything he taught me in an E-mail.  

There was some miscommunication about an inverter. I did not recieve the one I had thought I was getting. This is a good thing because it allowed the Renogy team to demonstrate their customer service ethic. They promised a full refund and free shippig to return the incorrect ordered product. This is actually what sold me on Renogy. I know that I can trust this company. If that did not seal the deal, They sent 2 more cables that did not come with the kit at no extra cost. 

I also spoke to a manager, Quishaun, about getting a third cable free. I however did not find cause for them to send me a third cable for free. I argued several points with yhis manager why I believed I was owed a third cable. The manager had complete control of his attitude and emotions showing me courtesy and respect, conveying his point as to why the company did not owe me a third cable for free. He did this with outstanding customer service. To spread the icing on the cake, he discounted the cable for me showing me good business to customer relations. He did not have to do that and he did it any way. 


Aside from the excellent customer service experience, Renogy has proven to have top of the line products at inexpensive and competetive prices. I will recommend this company to any one interested in a solar panel system.  

This is a 5 star company in my book.

Ross explained all the steps and timelines of the project.

They took the time to answer all my questions and I never felt like I was being pressured to purchase a system. Even after my system was up and running they followed up with me several times to see how things were going and if I needed help with anything. Follow up is important to me and BSSS was there every step of the way. Their team far exceeded my expectation. It is a great feeling to check the app everyday and see how much energy my system produced and how much money I am saving. Why anyone who has the right home for solar would not do this is beyond me.

From that point forward, the process was seamless. Ross Solar managed everything very professionally and on time; they communicated well throughout; and the installation itself was done with minimal impact on us. 

I've had the system now for 2 years, and it has run without interruption for the whole time. It has generated about 15-18% more power than we projected, and my electricity bills have dropped significantly, probably 80% or more.

540,545,21438,"2014 - Solar businesses had been irritating me with cold calls and in your face solicitations at Home Depot for quite some time. But when I noticed a whole tract of homes being built nearby, all with new solar panels on their roofs, I was intrigued. By September 2014, I had 5 months of bills ranging between $400 to mid $500 each month. Add to that, bloodsucking Edison had just raised their rates (yet again), my usually high threshold for anger finally peaked and I started shopping. 

That's when I heard about Dan C, solar sales rep and possibly skilled vampire killer. 

He came to our house in September bringing with him his finest professionalism, a brain full of knowledge, an easy manner, and thankfully, no garlic essence or wooden stakes. I tried to stump him with my myriad of questions, but he charmed me like a champ. He unraveled the 4-tiered highway robbery techniques of Edison, and explained the many hurdles we would have to jump before getting our system completed. And once I saw the light, he worked with me to get some necessary work done before the installation (i.e. tree trimming/removal to minimize shade on my south facing roof, an upgraded electrical box, and some roof repair).  Once I said ""Let's do it"", I heard from him at least once a week, sometimes more.  And I could call him anytime and he ***jaw dropping*** returns my calls immediately.

The actual work involved several different crews, each with their own expertise. They were polite, prompt and hard working, especially cleaning up after themselves.  The entire process from start to finish was about 4 months, not bad.

My roof was not big enough to hold enough panels to completely wipe out my total usage, and the real results came as the daylight hours got longer, but I am looking forward to framing for posterity my new, considerably lower electric bills. Right next to the old, obscene SCE ones. I might also find myself hanging an 8x10 framed, autographed picture of smiling Dan in his company t-shirt.

It is now better than a year since installation, and the latest news about Edison is, they are figuring out new ways to punish us, raising rates again for those without solar, cleverly changing the tier pricing, and surcharging those of us that do have solar who have a monthly bill less than $10.  So if your bill is in negative territory, meaning you are actually generating more than you use, you will be whipped appropriately. Don't let that stop you.

Also, you should know that since the number of panels generated less than our usage this year (Solar Max warned us ahead of time), at the end of the first 12 months Edison billed us an additional $800 (half of that caused by a rogue air conditioning unit that malfunctioned while we were on a week's summer vacation).  My investment still helped me save at least $3000 in 2015 (i.e. it will pay for itself in ~5-6 years).   I can assure you it will be greater savings next year due to more changes in our overall usage and lifestyle.  I am happy.

Tip:  Keep those solar panels clean!

541,546,21457,"Ed and Paul did a great job with the installation of my solar system. Ed was the salesman and came to my home giving me multiple options for my system. He explained the system well and even reworked a new system when my roof was 6 inches too short for the original system. The new reworked system was higher efficiency solar panels that had to be pre ordered. He did a great job and has continued to be a quick response to any questions I have even today. 

Paul was the contractor who came in to install the system with his brother. They both were very meticulous which was a big thing for me. Being the first time they installed a few different components to my sytem, they did a great job handling the new equipment.

543,548,21434,"This crew has been excellent! They are all lovely interesting people, who were so helpful every step of the way!

We had a a misunderstanding and if this had been done I could have had the panels a little lower in my field and they would have been completely hidden from the house.
IF a problem arose some one would be there that day, and they were all available for questions 24/7!
BUT I am so happy I had this group....I would not have wanted anyone else. Bhima was always looking for the BEST PRICE for ME! to help save in the cost.

555,560,21554,"I just purchased a 5.5Kw system installed by Solar Universe right after the July 4th weekend.  Twenty LG 275w panels with microinverters.

I got 4 quotes from different solar venders and Solar Universe was very competitive. Jeremy was my solar rep and he was outstanding in keeping in contact with me throughout the whole process.  He was very patient with my questions and was 100% dedicated to getting a system that met my requirements.

Solar Universe presented my proposal in a very nice report without any pressure to purchase.  They worked with me regarding some electrical issues and took care of it from their side.  Install went very fast and smooth and the panels are working great.  They installed the panels and painted all electrical conduits to match my house.  The electrical install was done professionally.

They handle all the paperwork that needs to be submitted to PGE and keep you updated on the status of the switch over.  They set up the website portal so you can get web updates on your panel production(if you have micro inverters).  It really has been very hassle free big house upgrade.

I recommend everyone to call Solar Universe (Livermore) for a quote when you are ready to look into solar.  You won't be disappointed

One particular vendor was incredibly rude and high pressure to get to my house for a quote and very high pressure during the quote process and after.  Their price was also double what Solar Universe price for a 5.1Kwh system.  Solar Universe was not rude or high pressure at all.  Do not let other vendors bad behavior tarnish the reps of other companies.  I learned a lot during this process.

A big shout out to my Yelp friend Kelleye B who has been a solar buddy in this whole process. :)",5,0.6249
556,561,21554,"I actually looked into quite a few solar companies before making my decision 1. to go solar and 2. who to go with. There are a TON of options it seems but really very few GOOD options. I ended up deciding to buy the solar system instead of leasing (which I am very happy I did). I was considering leasing through SunRun, SolarCity (which primarily lease) or buying through The Solar Company and Solar Universe. Let me just start by saying, you can have all these people over to your house if you want but you really are wasting your time. No company stands up to the quality of Solar Universe! 

I had Ben, who is their energy consultant, come over and he was SO HELPFUL. I was able to break down with him objectively what the other companies were offering compared to what my goals were (obviously save money and produce solar). Once again, let me save you time and headache, if you don't want 5 different people coming over to your house trying to sell you garbage, have Ben consult you! He is a straight forward guy who is extremely knowledgable and helpful. He was so helpful I ended up asking him for recommendations for some roofing I needed done (which was also great). I didn't work with any of their other consultants so I cant speak to that but he was great.

Finally the time came to install my solar and just like my preceding experience, the work that was done was once again top notch! It's the little details that matter from installing great looking low-profile panels, to painting the conduit (my neighbor has solar done by SolarCity and all the conduit is not painted and exposed, looking not great) it all looks great. 

In the end they were fast with the installation (1 day!) and the permitting (next day!).

We were on track to re-coupe our investment within 5 years and enjoy terrific energy savings for the rest of our time here.  Now it looks like that point won't be reached by year 6.5.

584,589,21513,"In October of 2014 my wife and I began a journey into the world of Solar Energy. We did this not so much to “save the planet”, but to reduce our monthly electric bill which was substantial (especially in the summer months when the temperature in Las Vegas often reaches and exceed 115° Fahrenheit). We’d been living in our current house for a little over 18 years. Over the years, we have spent a good deal of money attempting to stay ahead of an ever increasing monthly energy bill including…
     • Installing a total of 30 Rolladen Rolling Shutters on every window,
        door and sliding door in our house (completed in 2004)
     •	Converting all incandescent lighting (mainly halogen) to LEDs
        and a few fluorescents (completed in 2013)
     •	Sealing our attic to an average R-48 insulation level (completed in
        2014)
     •	Installing a 18.7 KW Photovoltaic Array on our roof (completed in
        2014)

The last 2 items on this list were performed by Today’s Energy Store (TES) located in Henderson, NV. When we started this project we were not aware of the number of “technological and bureaucratic hoops” that would need to be addressed before we realized our “dream solar farm”. Our goal from the beginning was to reduce our monthly electrical bill to as close to “zero” as possible – banking energy during the sunny months and drawing on this banked energy reserve anytime our usage surpassed our generation capability. To achieve this goal, a good deal of analysis was required playing off our energy usage and the coat of energy in the marketplace, as well as, the never ending stream of regulations at the local, state and federal levels. The bulk of this work was performed by Edward Trott, an extremely component and patience individual. I’m an electrical engineer and my wife is a MBA. If I wasn’t probing Ed for more technical information, my wife was hitting him up for a better understanding of the business model. I felt that Ed never failed us and was a consonant professional during the entire design, installation and operational phases of this project. Today, I still rely on Ed as my principal conduit into the resources of TES. 

Other than Ed, kudos go out to Bill Douglas and his crew who were responsible for sealing my attic, For anyone out there that is really serious about solar power, you need to do everything possible not to waste energy. Since sealing the attic, the temperature within my house (5,000 sq. ft.) has noticeable stabilized and both our electricity usage and natural gas usage has dropped. Anyone considering a solar installation should make room in their budget for sealing their attic.

Finally, thanks to Marc Hale (electrician and owner of TES) for his responsiveness when any technical problem arises. Even though the solar industry is maturing and the reliability of equipment is improving by “leaps and bounds”, there is still a need for a technical team to diagnose and address problems if and when “the lights go out”. Marc has assembled such a team, and I would highly encourage anyone seeking a solar solution to give Today’s Energy Store a hard look. I believe that they are very cost competitive, but more important, is their experience base and professional integrity.

588,593,20054,"I chose GreenPowerEnergy from a list of seven solar installers, some big household names some smaller ones.  GreenPower was an easy decision for me
- they listened to my specific needs: I have a complicated roof topology and all other providers tried to limit the system capacity to keep the installation simple for them
- they were the only ones who physically measured the roof immediately to come up with a credible proposal
- they had a very competitive price point
- they had a track record (including references they readily provided) with installations on metal roofs, which I have

After making the decision, I could not have been more satisfied. Tim DeSevo has been incredibly responsive.  Not a single question/inquiry - and I had many - wasn’t answered the same day. GreenPower did exactly what they said they would.

The installation itself was done very well.  The crew was very courteous, professional and competent and worked hard to accommodate particular likes/dislikes. For example, our roof topology required a complex conduit setup that we wanted to be visually as  unobtrusive as possible.  The crew really thought hard about ways to accommodate us and went the extra mile to make it happen.

He obviously had a sound knowledge of the state of solar installation in MA and the way it worked, and, although I had a bid from another company, I decided to go with SunBug because of their local experience and history of installing client-owned systems. Mike checked out my site and produced a well-thought-out proposal and budget, which SunBug stuck to except for $300 for structural reinforcement of the roof. I signed the contract in early January.

One of the companies had limited experience with residential installations and was not knowledgeable about the rebate from the state, the federal and state tax credits or how to work with my electric company on the net metering.  This company was excluded from consideration very quickly.  The second company was primarily interested in leasing my roof and selling the electricity back to me at a reduced rate.

In part I went with SunBug because, by far, Ben was the most knowledgeable and honest sales person I had dealt with.  The design of the system, both electrical and esthetic, was excellent.  Installation was done with professionalism and care for my property.

The system has been operational for three years and has done exactly what I expected it to do.  I have had no issues with any of the panels or inverters.

What didn't they do well:
The biggest issue has been service, or lack there-of.  Fortunately, the PV aspect of the system is working well.  However, I've had intermittent issues with SunBug's monitoring system since shortly after installation.  Mostly, the kWH consumed reports about half the actual load for a few weeks, then fixes itself.  I've spoken to them repeatedly about it they've never come out to look at it, have repeatedly said ""we'll look into it"" and never did.

This gave me great confidence that the installation would be high-quality, and they did not disappoint.

The hand-off from Richard (sales) to Aaron (project management) was handled smoothly, and the installation process went exactly as it had been discussed at the proposal stage.  The cost was exactly what we had agreed to.  I always felt that everyone I interacted with at SunBug was accountable and invested in seeing our installation completed successfully.

As promised, SunBug handled the permitting and paperwork with the City and the utility, and set up the monitoring.  We signed the contract at the end of January, and the system was turned on in mid-July.

SunBug’s initial system cost was not the lowest we received, but the detailed financial analysis offered provided the information to see that it would be the best investment.

626,631,713,"I purchased a 5.30 kWh system from SunBug Solar three years ago in September, and I highly recommend them to anyone that cares to listen. 

The whole operation is knowledgeable, courteous, and very professional. Hmm, all true, but very “stuffy” now that I read it over. Honestly, these are some of the nicest, and smartest people I’ve ever dealt with. Their capable team will handle all the paperwork (which is substantial), and keeps you informed throughout the whole process. 

Let’s not forget the installation and electricians who did an outstanding job of putting them up, and making it look as though there isn’t a wire or connector attached to them anywhere . . . remarkable.

As I mentioned above, my system size is considered to be 5.30 kWh, but has actually over-produced by a full megawatt each year that I can attest to, making it effectively a 6.3 kWh system. So don’t think they are over-inflating your production values. Of course, this is all subject to the amount of sunny/rainy days over the course of a year.

Now for the return on investment (ROI):
I did receive a number of incentives (State/Fed) when I purchased my system, almost 3 years ago. All of which may not be available now, but if you were seriously considering going solar, I’d look into it sooner rather than later because once funds run out, they may not be offered again. 

I can safely say . . . my system has already paid for itself, which is due to a number of factors, and not just the State/Federal incentives. Or, the fact I haven’t had to pay for my electricity since installation. Actually, my total bill for May last year to this year was $47 . . . must have been all those darn Christmas lights.  ;-)

Depending on your household heating needs, the cost-savings will vary. In my case, I use home heating oil, which also produced my hot water. Since installing the panels, I have changed my oil-fired hot water heater to an electric (hybrid) hot water tank (aka: heat-pump), which switched heating the water from oil to solar power, and has reduced the number of times I need to have the oil tank filled by almost a tank a year (which is factored into my ROI calculations). 

So, between these factors: Government incentives, less heating oil, the 15 Megawatts I’ve already produced, along with something I haven’t mentioned yet . . . Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs), which buys every Megawatt you produce for 10 years. SRECs are a lot more complicated than you want to read about here. I would recommend reading up about them here: http://www.mass.gov/eea/energy-utilities-clean-tech/renewable-energy/solar/rps-solar-carve-out-2/. 

As for maintenance costs, I haven’t had any since installed. But I am still in contact with SunBug on a regular basis . . . usually, to brag about my production, or to ask all the little questions that inevitably come up along the way. I must say Mike O. has never made me feel like I was bothering him with any of my questions, big or small.

Bottom line: I have never once regretted my choice of installing with SunBug Solar, and I couldn’t be any happier with the decision to install solar in general. It’s more than just the savings . . . it’s how it makes you feel about yourself at the end of the day. ",5,0.8807

They said that they were conservative with their production estimates and that has truly been the case.The system has performed beyond what they told me to expect.

I had several questions and they were quite patient in answering all of them to my satisfaction.  After signing the contract, they were expedient in getting the permits submitted, and then doing the installation after the permit was granted.

Each individual we had contact with—from the rep, to the office staff, to the installers—was professional, friendly, and helpful. No sales pressure here—as we experienced with another company we explored. Our rep, Chris, patiently explained a multitude of options. Once we decided to proceed, it was originally going to be about six months until installation. It turned out they had an opening earlier and squeezed us in. So we were up and running much faster than we'd expected. With the federal tax rebate, I was anxious about keeping track of receipts, and then it turned out they gave them all to us, printed out, in our final packet. What a nice touch. I can't think of another home-improvement experience I've had that has been easier or more pleasant. And we just received our most recent electric bill—$0.",5,0.7501

Sunbug was the only one that spent time checking out our roof and taking measurements and then sitting down to explain all the options, from types of panels to own/lease. They suggested a roofing contractor, which worked out great. Their installation process went 98% as planned and was quick and within the budget. When we ran into a hiccup with getting the online monitoring system to work, they put in the extra time to get it done right. And also, they are a local company.

I purchased a 15 kW system. I'm pleased and amazed that my system is actually producing at a higher rate than projected.

I was pleased to work with Renzo Castillo and the two or three others from Solar Union who patiently answered my many questions regarding usage, size, installation and most important cost.  Financing was a smoother process than anticipated, installation, which took a bit longer than anticipated was delayed by the county inspection process. Our system has been in place for nearly three months and to tell you the truth I've not even give it an afterthought.  I've not had a light bill in this time and hope to make it through Bakersfield's 110 summers with a minimal to no electric bill.  Add to the fact that this system should be paid off in 7-10 years, with finance interest payments, because of the PACE program, being tax deductible who could ask for anything more.

During the few power outages that I have had with URE, as planned I disconnect automatically and simultaneously, roll over to my sub panel, and basically have all the power I need for the ""important"" stuff:  garage/chest freezer, back up frig, aerator on septic, well pump, and barn.  Bob and Eric were very responsive, provided great follow up, detailed information, and have integrity.  The only delays experienced were with the utility company.  As advertised, I am in the black in the summer, even in spring and fall, and in the red in winter regarding energy usage and production.  The low bills (mainly connection fees) are nice, but the real peace of mind is knowing that if there is a long term outage I'm good to go.

703,708,21562,"I was very happy with SES and I would hire them again.  The people I dealt with were always very helpful and accommodating.

I got estimates for my PV system from several companies.  One of which was the company I had used 8 years ago to install my solar hot-water system.  That hot-water system provided some challenges in terms of the layout for the new PV system on my roof.  Comparing all proposals I decided to go with Standard Solar because I felt they did not promise anything they couldn't deliver.  Overall the installation itself went without any problems and was very fast.  They finished installing the panels within one day if I remember correctly.  There were challenges along the way only due to scheduling issues.  I had to have my roof replaced prior to installing the PV system.  The new roof required my existing solar hot-water system to be taken down first - this was done by a sub-contractor of Standard Solar - and put back up after the roof replacement, and due to the bad weather during that time the schedule was pushed back several times.  This was unfortunate but nobodies fault.

Once the PV system was installed BGE was dragging their feet for a while to install the net meter and BGE also made a mistake with the billing not recognizing the net-metering but all of that was resolved after a few phone calls. Standard Solar was extremely helpful and pro-active in addressing the issues as best as they could.

I had read some horrible stories online and encountered two high pressure companies that tried to get me to sign a contract within 30 mins of coming in my home. After being told by two different people that I should use Professional Electrical I decided to give them a call. When they showed up they first looked at my roof and told me that when I was ready they could do the job and quoted me a price. Mark told me he would send me the details in an email. HE NEVER CAME IN MY HOUSE AND NEVER ASKED ME TO SIGN ANYTHING. He sent me references and a copy of the contract to go over. Quite different than anything I expected. After calling his references I called Mark back and told them I was ready to go forward. It took about 3 weeks for them to get everything together but then they were done in 3 days.

They had to make an unexpected change to our electrical bax and did so at their cost. Our only snag was an oversight on one of the loans for the 30% tax refund. We didn't realize that we would not recieve it all at once due to the fact that we have our own business and have alot of write-offs, and, although we will ultimately recieve it, we will only recieve a portion every year for quite a few years.

707,712,20831,"I heartily recommend Connecticut Solar Power LLC. Here’s why. 
I did my research before hand, comparing panels, systems, cost, and installers. I wanted a firm that would do a good job advising me about the solar panels and do an excellent job of installing the system. Rob Trezza met both criteria. His background as a roofer and his experience as a solar installer were evident from the start. He and his crew took extra care during the installation by running the conduit inside our house rather than simply take the easy path of running the conduit on the outside. They took care in mounting the equipment where we had agreed and did so securely and neatly. 
I wanted to own the system and Rob did the math to show that I could recoup the investment in less than six years. We looked at several available panels and Rob helped me choose one that did the job at a reasonable price. 
There are a number of steps in a solar system. CT Solar Power helped me navigate the process so that I had a home energy audit, received engineering approval for roof structure, obtained CT state rebates, inspections and approvals and town permits and signoff. 
Finally, I am very happy with the final product. I have eliminated electric usage charges over the two years the system has been installed and I expect that to continue.

Since my original purchase of a 3kW system, Power Guru has set up a battery bank and inverter system for me and the care his people took in educating me and my wife was unbelievable.

724,729,20619,"Since I am an engineer it is my nature to spend countless hours of research and spreadsheets before I come to a decision on any investment for my family. In the case of solar this was no different. The numbers make sense with the tax credit and state rebate so my family and I decided to make the plunge. The next step of the process began, which entailed screening the many solar companies in the area for the one that would serve our needs best. It became very clear that Celestial Innovations was the right choice. Jim Reilly gave a very thorough presentation and answered all of the detailed questions I had encountered. He was professional throughout the entire process and never put on the pressure to sign (like many of the hard sale pitches we encountered). He is also not looking to take advantage of folks by trying to sell them on leasing programs or power purchase agreements, where the customer does not receive the Federal and State incentives.

Not only was the customer service outstanding from start to finish, but the pricing and warranties were very competitive. I cannot begin to emphasize enough how accommodating Jim was from quoting out the many different panels I was interested in to working around my busy schedule so that I could be available during the install.

Unlike other companies where the salesman hands you off, Jim was our contact throughout the entire process. The county permit, utility paperwork and HOA application were handled by Celestial making the process very simple. In addition to the excellent customer Jim’s installation team was very professional, answering any questions or concerns I had.

Now that our solar is live, we couldn't be happier with the performance of the system. The installers did a great job taking pride in the appearance of the array. Initially I was concerned about how the conduit would look but everything is very clean.

My only frustration was finding that my system was not big enough to cover my energy use for my old, inefficient house. This was in part my fault since I had not been in the home long enough to know what our actual use would be, but I do wish they had made this a little clearer up front since I am now making payments for my solar (I bought) and a paying SDG&E to run my AC when I was under the impression I would have ore than enough power to cover my use. 

The only other issue I had was with some sloppy finish work around the panel they installed. I had to ask them to come back out to fix it, which they did quickly and apologetically. In the grand scheme of things this was small though and well worth the better price they gave me compared to the several other companies I compared when shopping. 

That aside, these guys bent over backward for me, were always polite and accommodating. Their crew worked quickly and professionally and have been monitoring my system since. Everything is working great now and I only pay $9 a month for my SDG&E bill (without using AC). They helped me to get my system financed at a very good rate and get my tax credit which saved a ton. They also replaced my roof while they were at it for a very reasonable price! 

All in all, I am happy with their service and would not hesitate to recommend them. Just do your homework and be sure you know how much of your energy use your system will cover to avoid any surprises. ",4,0.836

747,752,1364,"Guardian Solar has to be the most unprofessional Solar and worst Installer in the Central Florida area. It was nothing but problems from the get go. It was very obvious that there was no pre-planning involved in our solar panel installation. The first question they asked when they arrived on site was: who is your electrical utility provider? Are you kidding me? They did not even know this basic question that had been talked about and conveyed during the purchasing of the system. They did not bring with them the contracted solar panels, we had signed a contract for SolarWorld Sunmodule Plus SW 290 Mono and they installed SolarWorld Sunmodule Plus SW 285 Mono. When I asked why the discrepancy, I received a curt answer from Danny, the owner/installer sending me to talk to the salesperson. If I had not inspected the solar panels I would have not been aware of the change and would have not been told. In addition, they did not bring with them a Solar Fan that was part of the installation, his answer was ""I don't know anything about that go talk to the salesman"". They did not pick up after themselves either and left electrical tape and plastic bags all over the yard which I had to clean up. They installed the system on May 16, 2016 and it did not become operational until June 10, 2016 after multiple follow-ups on my part. It turned out that this was their first installation in OUC (Orlando Utilities Commission) territory and they did not know the process involved in getting the system up and operational. We gave 1/3 of the cost upfront and we did not pay them the additional 2/3's of the cost until the system was operational. We love our system and hope to never have any problems/issues since we do not want Guardian Solar ever again back in our premises.",1,-0.8268

750,755,20688,"SolarPlus installed a ground array for my home in Prather. Before deciding what size of array we needed, they came in and did an entire house inspection to see what  our needs would be.

Our house is @2400 square feet and all electric, with an average summer bill of $500.00. OUCH!!! This year, we are paying anywhere from $0.00 to $50.00. How great is that!!! The array is perfect. 

I can't say enough good things about Brandi and Terry, the owners of this company. Not only was their price the absolute best that I received, but their service was above expectation.

752,757,20030,"I was initially apprehensive about doing business with this small company that has only been in business since 2011.  I initially wanted the supposed long term stability of a much larger solar/roofing company that has been in business for much longer, but SolarUnion totally won me over with their knowledge, patience, responsiveness, selection of top quality components at great prices and a highly competitive bid.  

I don't believe it was easy for Renzo Castillo and Ivan of SolarUnion to win my business.  Renzo has never failed to be patient to answer all my questions and accommodate my requirements.  SolarUnion has earned my business not by slick sales talks but by going the extra mile. 

Renzo took the time to explain to me in great detail the reasoning behind SolarUnion's selection of components.  Ivan and Renzo have the brains to select components that perform very well, reliably, and are offered at highly competitive prices from manufacturers that are likely to stay in business for many years to come in case warranty issues arise.  

Don't let the fact that the modules are Chinese-made scare you.  The Trinasmart panels SolarUnion offers perform VERY WELL.  Renzo made me a believer in the virtues of a system based on Trinasmart panels and Tigo optimizers.  I am very pleased.

About the only drawbacks I can think of with SolarUnion are that subcontractors do all the installation work for them and that SolarUnion is really a small company.  SolarUnion doesn't have its own crew of installers, but this is probably an advantage in that it gives them flexibility and be more competitive.  The more competitive they are the more likely they will remain profitable and stay in business.  I absolutely want my solar installer to be around many years from now when I need them.

SolarUnion is somewhat unique in that they offer a ""Trifecta"" triple guarantee, which includes a solar energy production guarantee, i.e. they guarantee your solar system will produce a certain number of kWhs every year.  It may sound too good to be true, but based on this Trifecta guarantee, SolarUnion would have to replace a very expensive main inverter at their expense if it ever breaks down in the next 25 yrs.  It may sound too good to be true, but Renzo confirms in his email reply that this is how SolarUnion interprets the Trifecta guarantee.  We shall see if they is really true.

My positive review is a reflection of my experience so far (up to the point of a newly completed installation).  It is not reflective of any post-installation interactions that may require warranty/corrective work since I have no need for warranty/corrective work yet.  I have every expectation that SolarUnion will stay in business for many, many years to come and that I will be as pleased with them in the next 25 yrs. as I am today.",5,0.9504

We were very eager to get solar installed quickly and the company did everything possible to facilitate this for us. When we had questions or wanted specifications on equipment to be used, they readily sent over the information, and answered all our questions and concerns. They also had a great financing rate and excellent service through a credit union they use.  Alex gave us data charts to show when we would break even and other valuable information.  The staff was always available through phone or email during the installation process.  We got two other estimates that had similar pricing; however we were impressed with U.S. Green’s bidding and installation process, and the performance of the proposed equipment.

My only regret is not first going sooner and second not being able to get the panels that are much more efficient but not made in this state... so in order to maximize my incentives I had to go with the older style panels... however the purchase cost still is way better with these and it will easily eliminate my electric bill if I keep up with my energy saving ways.

804,809,21660,"Glen Koedding and his every member of his team at Green Sun Energy have made the entire process of switching to solar a pleasure. From the beginning, he was comprehensive and detailed in his explanation of the product, responsive and informative about every question and concern, and professional and timely with the installation and all of the paperwork.

I am still in shock - since our installation I have not had to pay a single bill to JCP&L -- every month I get a statement that I owe $0! And soon, I will be getting money back from NJ for my SRECs! This is a wonderful investment and has been a wonderful experience.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to save money or make money by merely harnessing the sun that is out there! It's all good! ",5,0.8126
805,810,21660,"Everything they said was true and accurate. I generated almost a 1000 kWh than my estimate. The entire year cost me 26 dollars for electric. With the Srecs and the electric savings I should recoup my investment in 4 years. Thanks again, Jack Flannery",5,0.4404
806,811,21660,Glen and his staff did an outstanding job with the solar installation.

808,813,21660,"From the initial Sales call through the installation process and all of the red tape (trust me there's a lot) Green Sun took the time to explain everything to me from what a micro inverter is, to an SREC. I was informed every step of the way and when I called or emailed with a question or concern, someone always got back to me. 

If you have called any contractor's lately, how many return you call? Everyone is professional and you get a high quality install w/ high quality equipment. There's no guessing, you know exactly what you're getting and how much energy you will produce. 

I had too may ""other"" solar companies that just wanted me to sign a contract and not ask any questions. Not the experience I want for a large investment like a Solar system!

Once you call Green Sun for a proposal, it will be easy to determine who's who. You'll be happy you called them. ",5,0.5719

One problem was that no one from Management was here during installation but again installers may not have needed them. The only other problem was that electrician only seemed to work part time. Took longer than expected. When it came time for the town inspection, they were here all day waiting for electric and building inspections that came at different times during the day.

816,821,6520,"I'm not one to take the time to write a review. However, SunBlue was exceptional from start to finish.  And it was not just at the start with the sales process.  Everyone from the sales, project management, and installers were first rate.  Benefit that SunBlue has is these are all employees of SunBlue, so they all have a vested interest in each customer.   

I'm one of those people who does a lot of research before speaking with anyone...which is why EnergySage was a fantastic place to start.  Thus I had a lot of questions when we first spoke - which they always handled promptly by email - so it was at my convenience.  After narrowing it down to 3 Co, I reached out to have a call with each Co.  From the first contact SunBlue's Jonathan Bonhomme was direct, factual, prompt, and patient with all my questions.  Of all the Co's I spoke to, Jonathan was the most forthright and always the first to follow through and respond. Between that, the fact they are local, price was in line with other Co, and do not subcontract - signing with them was an easy choice. 

Once I agreed to start - I'll sum it up like this....""What he said they would do, is exactly what they did."" They handled everything. From walking me through the loan application process, to filling for the building permit, reaching out to ConEdison & adding bracing in my attic. They even have a Notary for the forms that needed to be notarized. They came to my home or office which ever was most convenient to me.

The whole project ran like clockwork - thanks to Richez who managed the over all process.  I believe I received my building permit on a Friday.  The following Thursday - they started the install.  That first day - they did put all the electric in place and braced the attic.  I don't know about you, but I have lots of stuff in my attic.  Items were moved with care and there was no mess anywhere when they were done.  Unfortunately, we then had four days of rain so they could not complete the job until the end of the following week. Weather broke & the crew was back on site and finished the install that day. Of course they handled the electrical inspection and certification. Once that was done, ConEd came within a week (I was surprised about that) and put the new meter in  so I could turn on the system. SunBlue then came back and took the time to provide a complete walk through of the system, provided me copies of all documentation including the roof & solar survey's, contracts, and equipment warranties. 

Systems been on for about 3 weeks now.  Production is what they projected and I have full confidence that I'll be able to cover 100% of my usage over a 12 month period. 

If I had to do it all over again - I would go right back to SunBlue. ",5,0.765
817,822,21514,Sugar Hollow did an excellent install for us.  Work was done as scheduled and site cleanup was meticulous.  Staff is extremely knowledgeable.

818,823,21514,"We called two solar energy companies to get estimates for a solar hot water system that would connect to our radiant floor heat.  (We were paying an exorbitant price for propane.)  One of the companies gave us an estimate and a sketch of a system without many details.  The other company said that our home posed too many challenges (e.g., no south-facing roof, utilities on the north end of the house), so they recommended Sugar Hollow Solar (actually its predecessor, which had two employees who have built this company--Phelps Clarke and Keith Holdsworth).  They said that Clarke and Holdsworth could design a custom system for us.  We were extremely pleased with the design and the knowledge base of Clarke and Holdsworth--both extremely technical and creative.  And I should mention that my husband does not like contractors, as a rule, and generally feels that he can do a better job than most, so he tests them with questions--but he had no doubts about these two guys (and he felt that the other solar representative who gave us an estimate did not have a similar knowledge base).  Instead of an estimate, we got an amazing design with no charge (a landscape architect would have charged at least $500 for a similarly detailed design).  However, we felt that the payback time was longer than some other options that were more suited to our home, so we never had the system installed.  But we have used Sugar Hollow Solar to help with our geothermal system (great work) and have recommended them to friends.  We've seen Phelps driving to service our neighbor's system that was installed by another company.  So we are glad that Sugar Hollow Solar is growing.  Phelps also mentioned to me that the company is getting so much experience that they are really reducing the time (and labor cost) it takes to install a solar system.

3.2KWh System installed 09/17/2014

Affordability:
PV Solar Systems are thought to be quite expensive, often taking 12 - 15 years to pay for itself.. so, most people pass on the opportunity to take the plunge. That was my case, too. Solar City quoted me $21,000 (yikes) back in 2010 and after a 30% Federal Tax Credit (Renewable Energy Credit) their system was still $14,000.. I concluded it would take me 14-15 years for such a system to be justified (since my PG&E electric bill averaged about $85/month or $1020 annually. Solar Companies today (like Solar City and Sungevity) resort to ""leasing you a system"" because it appears to be less costly (on a monthly basis). What they don't tell you (at least, proactively) is that a lease often is much more expensive than a purchase. Most Solar leases are 20-25 years long for at least $100 per month. Do the math: 25 years x $100 = $25,000 over the life of the lease.. Sure, a lease offers you peace of mind and ""free repairs"" if something wears out, but the fact is, in a 20 year period, the only thing that will need replacement is the $1400 inverter, which is warranted for 10 years. The other parts of the system (the PV panels) are warranted for 25 years. Bottom line: the best way to go is a purchase.. 

My purchased system from Sunwork.org (not leased) cost only $9900 - 30% Federal Tax Credit (Renewable Energy Credit) for a net price of $6930.. making it possible to justify the initial cash outlay (in the form of savings) in about 6 1/2 years. After that, your electrical power is essentially ""free"". Larger systems will, of course, cost a bit more, but you would be off-setting a larger PG&E electric bill and your savings would pay for themselves in roughly the same amount of time.

I'm about 2 years into this purchase and I continue to be very pleased with the performance and ROI of my PV System. I've generated over 11MWh of cumulative power since my PV System was first turned on 9/2014. Other than my connection fee to PG&E (something all PG&E Customers pay), my annual electric bill has essentially been $0 (I'm actually running a small credit ;-) 

If you'd like to learn more or have additional questions, I encourage you to contact Mike at Sunwork.org (he's the real expert ;-) Feel free to let Mike know that I referred you (no, I don't work on commission ;-) but I'm sure Mike would be pleased to know that a fellow neighbor spoke highly of them).

He simply presented the facts and options available to us, at which point my husband and I were given time to talk it over - again, without the sense of being pressured to make a decision. 
The follow-up from that point was no less exceptional, with timely responses to our inquiries, as well as updates with the progression of the installation, inspections and activation. 
What a relief to finally be done with four to five hundred dollar Edison bills in summer. Our last bill was only $105.00 - this was after a heat wave, no less, when we were continuously running both air conditioners for a good portion of the day and evening. The reason we owed $105.00, is because the solar had been activated for only two weeks during the thirty day billing cycle; I can't wait to see our next bill! : )

Next steps by DYLAN ROLLERI to get my project going were completely seamless. He knew I was intent on making this a speedy process and I am glad I was able to assist with getting my permits approved.

The installation, both outside and inside, is neat and clean. They've been very helpful in navigating the regulatory complexity (power company, solar credits company, town permits, etc.).

Their internal communication fell slightly short when the worker who did the final indoor configuration didn't come with the mandatory indoor and outdoor labels for the equipment, so a second trip was needed.

The install team was courteous and really helpful whenever I had any questions. They really ensured that I knew what was going on in my system. 

All in all, Tim and his team were fantastic. He's always available via phone, email or text and has never failed to answer any questions I've thrown at him. I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 5 minutes for a response from anyone at the company.

860,865,252,"I want you to be aware of what I was caught by with the Fafco warranty.  The sales guy was quick to point out the 20 year parts and labor warranty on the panels.  I thought that was good, but I questioned him.  He informed me that if the panels failed within the first twenty years, they would fix it.  Awesome right?  Well the panels and the pipes are not one in the same.  The piping has a two year warranty.  The piping failed for my application after two years...oops $$.  The panels themselves have failed three (3) times.  Each time they have been fixed by a local company that Fafco chose (not my choice because I called my preferred company, and Fafco will not sell them the $8 part for the repair).  So the company comes out and fixes the panels each time, but I get charged a service call of $95.  The first two times this happened, this was the only charge on my bill.  I contested it but the company informed me that I don't have to pay the labor or part but I do have to cover the trip out.  I paid and let it go.  The third time this happened was just recently, and the tech wrote the service call, part, and labor charge on the bill, but he scribbled out the labor and part charges.  I could still read them.  $8 for the part and $20 for labor...oh, and the $95 service call charge which I was responsible for.  I called Fafco to make sure the company was not charging me and them for additional labor.  Nope..Fafco informed me that the service charge was my responsibility.  You decide for yourself, but I want to make sure you are aware of the whole truth behind Fafco's warranty that you will end up paying most of with your hard earned money.",1,-0.5106

We were told that the install process would take at most 3 days but went out to about double that amount.  The communication with the company was not as clear as I would like during the install process and some of the PV panel placements and grounding were not as expected (we'll have to buy a bigger ladder to reach some parts of the roof).  The install documents and manuals were not received in a timely manner (not received as of yet).  In the end the install looks great.  I'd recommend better scheduling and communication.

The estimate was accurate (no hidden costs), their people were available every time I reached out and the team truly went above and beyond with their customer service (even helped me remove some things from the backyard).

The installation went as planned, both timely and without any hiccups. My system is 14 panels at 4.85 kW and has produced about 7500 kWh. Good Faith called me several times to ensure my installation was perfect and that the system was producing.  It off-set about 50% of my electricity costs this summer and I'm already brainstorming at how to install more.

I really have no complaints about anything except for the cost of solar itself.  As the technology improves and demand increases, prices will drop and solar becomes more and more feasible.

They don't do these terrible Solar city 20 year lease programs where the company owns your panels AND gets your huge Federal tax credit. If you go with SUNworks, you own the panels, which makes your house worth more money. And they don't use cheap panels from China, so the panels last way longer. 

I went with a 12 year loan, at a great interest rate, and I didn't have to pay any money up front. Also I saved a ton of money over what Solarcity would have cost after 20 years. Plus I have American made Sunpower panels, and I'm getting an $8,000 tax credit. The reasons to buy instead of lease are endless.

I must admit to being a CA licensed solar contractor having experience in the utility scale solar power plant fields in domestic and international projects.

With this background and knowledge I approached six local solar contractors for my personal home system. Five of them were solar installers that did not offer performance guarantees…just 25-year product warranties and limited labor warranties of 10 years or under. SolarUnion was the only contractor I found working under the solar developer model. They offered me a 25-year Performance Guarantee, which just blew me away. That operation/servicing agreement alone has huge value. Yet, they offered the entire solution to me plus the performance guarantee at a cost below that of standard solar installers that did not offer a performance guarantee at all. SolarUnion also offered me a roof integrity warranty under the same agreement. They also honored their word and gave me a guaranteed price at the time we signed the agreement so we had no unexpected change orders or cost overruns.

Ivan and Renzo put forward the best qualifying proposal with TrinaSmart modules, which have one the lowest default rates in utility scale projects. They worked with me providing transparency on other components and welcomed my design collaboration all throughout.

Given the attractiveness of the opportunity, I decided to over build the project to provide additional capacity for future electrical vehicle charging or future increased electrical appliance load.

During the entire process, I was kept very well informed and the team was diligent in procuring the permits, utility inspections and final acceptance as well as my rebate supplemental funding.

I happily recommend the team at SolarUnion for your solar investment.",5,0.836

Then we met Jordan and Daniel from Gold Rush Energy Solutions.  They knocked on our door one HOT Saturday afternoon.


Right away my wife and I liked these guys.  I had a lot of questions and they answered everything backing it up with documentation whenever I needed it.  They weren’t “Yes Men” though.  There were a couple of points that weren’t going to work but they came up with alternate approaches whenever possible.  We signed on the dotted line.


Less than a week later they and their team were on our roof putting in the system.  They had arrived right on time (maybe even a little early).  They were professional and neat as they worked.  Our neighbors had a team installing solar as well.  They had ordered theirs 2-3 months prior and they were finally getting the panels put up.  Their workers were definitely not on the same caliber as the Gold Rush Energy Solutions crew.  One big difference was that by noon when our solar was installed it was FULLY installed.  Ready to run.  The inspector showed up after lunch and was done in no time.  He was thrilled at the job they did with all of the electrical modifications and additions.  There was nothing for hime to complain about which made his paperwork very short and simple.  The house next door wasn’t even scheduled for inspection yet.  We had to wait a few days for PG&E to process us into the system for the meter changes they needed to do.  Then we were fully online.  The guys went out of their way and asked if we had any leftover house paint which we did.  They painted the metal conduit running up to the roof so that it blends in… neighbors is still an ugly silver/grey.

884,889,1034,"We have had our Solar system since March of 2013.  We have 42 solar panels on the back of our garage and house roof and those panels face perfectly south.  We decided to purchase our panels with an equity loan.

For the last two+ years our average monthly Eversource bill has been $19 and change per month.

What we've experienced is that our system generates enough excess electricity during the Spring to be able to absorb the summer months usage when the AC and Pool are running.  In the Fall we generate enough excess electricity to get us through the shorter days of the winter and the storms and snow fall.  Our roof is ""pitched"" fairly steeply so that in the winter when we get snow, usually, as soon as the sun comes out we get enough melting that the snow will slide off the roof fairly easily.  The negative is that I then get 2-3 feet on snow on my deck that I have to shovel.

This past spring after Eversource ""trues up"" our account by paying us for the excess electricity that they got from us as of the end of March, we had no electric bill for two months.

All-in-all it was a great investment.  We are getting ready to retire, so we've lowered our monthly ""operating costs"", we've increased the value of our house, and we'll get our money back on the back end when we decide to sell.",5,0.6395

892,897,21356,"(I write this review about three weeks after the installation.)

After weeks of considering solar, I decided to test the water and request quotes for my home. From those quotes, I selected (3) companies to come out and inspect the property to give a precise bid.  During the in-person home inspection and bid, I peppered the various contractors with questions,  asked for opinions, etc.  (Everything to system size, brand preferences, and how to ensure a solid installation on my second story roof.)

David and the folks at Repower were far and a way the most knowledgable.  They were not set on selling me one brand over any other (inverter or panel).  Instead, they explained the different advantages (and any drawbacks).  They didn't pressure me to make a decision.  They respected the size of the investment I was making, and I think they really helped me make the best choice for my home.  Based on my own personal research, I wanted specific equipment - and they got it for me.  Other contractors got in literal arguments with me over the unavailability of this or that.  David at Repower had no such ""supply"" problems.

During the course of the installation, I went up on the roof several times - taking pictures of the work in progress, speaking to the electrician and the various workers.  (Everything from how they liked their profession to whether they liked their current company - because a happy worker is usually a good worker).  I was impressed with what I heard and with what I saw.  I was also impressed that they were not upset or defensive that I was up there looking around.  They had nothing to hide.  They were doing quality work and were happy to show it off.

While I could go on and on, I'll just say that I would use Repower again.  They were not the lowest bid - but they were the most knowledgable people.  They were not the lowest bid - but they were far and away the best at working on my roof (a tile roof) and making sure that the roof was water tight when they were finished.  (e.g. They didn't ""fix"" cracked tiles - they replaced them with brand new originals from the tile distributor).  They were not the lowest bid, but they went the extra mile to do it all - even running the conduit exactly where I wanted it.

So if you place a value on workmanship, a value on the integrity of your roof, and a value on working with people that let you control the decisions - without pressure of any sort - then your choice is pretty simple.  David and his crew at Repower are simply terrific.",5,0.9167

Capturing solar energy is fairly easy and straight forward. 
Engineering and applying this function to a specific application requires critical experience and knowledge.
The need to coordinate the administration of a solar project with government, utilities, Inspectors, local boards and others is usually impossible for the owner.  APEX has made provision for all necessary  administrative and interpretive requirements.
APEX SOLAR POWER has combined these several  requirements successfully. The will quickly say NO to a marginal requirement.
In addition they have developed good communication,ethical and monetary practices.

900,905,21113,"Eastern CT Solar was one of six contractors that we considered for our home solar system. They included a large company, a franchised small business, electricians, and small businesses. We chose Eastern CT Solar because the owner, Charlie, was very patient and thorough in answering questions about the details of installation and choosing which financing approach to take. We felt that Charlie gave us the best assessment of how details of the installation would be handled and the installation would proceed so that no surprises would come up later. His information was correct. The technology that he sells was, in the opinion of one of his competitors, very good, and the project cost was significantly lower.
Once we signed the agreement, the project went forward as planned. We were impressed with the workmanship by Eastern CT Solar and its electrical subcontractor. They were all very pleasant to deal with. The job was completed with minimal fuss.
 
After the installation, we had a problem with downloading information from the system, which Charlie traced to a Wi-Fi router. Charlie came back to switch to a different router, and the system has operated flawlessly since that time.

Our system generated more than 1200 kWh of energy last month. It looks great, and we are very happy that we decided to take advantage of this technology and the financial inducements that are offered. We are looking at a 6-7 year payback on our investment, and gravy after that time. We highly recommend Eastern CT Solar and wish Charlie the best of luck in his endeavor.

902,907,1013,"If I could do it all over again I would never have signed a contract with this company.  The best experince with this company was meeting with their initial sales consultant after that it all went down hill and fast.  Communication with my Solar Lead was sparse at best unless I initiated, I understand it's a long process to get solar but timely updates are important.  During the install my property was damaged as well as treated by the installers as their own personal workshop, leaving wire and metal shavings in my driveway as well as on my deck, thanks guys I have little kids pretty thoughtful, and the damage I was told to get a quote for still hasn't been repaired despite repeated requests.  Then after my install it took over a month to get active, due to an issue with the town, although I was told by Direct Energy that were handling, I finally got frustrated and dealt with the town myself and guess what 2 days later all set, maybe I should be a Project Lead.  So I lost an entire month's worth of production waiting for Direct Energy.  To attempt to get resolve I emailed everyone in the company, operational leads, the executive board and again no contact.  So my $43,000 investment to a company who has yearly revenues in the millions means nothing.

With current federal and state tax incentives, and with the NYSERDA grant program the return on investment was quick and signing the contract was a ""no-brainer"".  The sales rep I worked with was honest and straight forward.  Installation was quick after signing and the crew did a nice clean installation in just two days - the time between signing and having an operational system was much quicker than I imagined it would be.

When the decision of how many panels to put on was made, kids were explained to about the way the circuits work. On day of installation, kids were shown how to see the tracking of energy production. APEX did not stop its relationship with us after the day of installation. I had questions the first couple of billing cycles.

922,927,20626,"sunWork has some of the nicest people on earth to do business with,
doing solar installations for all the right reasons, such as being aware of making a difference in the world by reducing our carbon footprint and relying on my own Sun light rather than distant power plants, and because it is the right thing to do.

They also recruit from nearby colleges the talents of engineering students who gain experience in designing solar systems, and well as giving supervised on-the-job training with Boots-on-the-Roof experience to people who want to actually do the roof-top work of installing solar panels.

While my project was in progress, a couple other people who had started with sunWork and then started separate solar installations but needed to borrow some needed tool were cheerfully accommodated.  So I got to watch the spread of solar expertise in real time.

After the installation is complete, sunWork people continue to be available online or by phone to help with questions such as Which energy plan from PG&E would be best for me? or Why did my computer stop showing me daily updates on my amount of solar power generated?

Also, I connected my Prius Plug-in's charging port to my system, so most of my driving time is relying on the sun on my roof!

sunWork also has the best price for solar installation.

My only regret is that we took so long to finally make the decision. I cannot say enough good things about Neil Saxon and his crew of professional installers. First, Neil is a Navy veteran and I felt like he gave me the solar facts I needed without the bull. Sardar (Proj Mgr) took care of all the preliminary paperwork, permits, and everything in-between the actual installation. Certainly, I could never find a better work crew than Sean and Christian if I picked them out myself. These guys were always courteous and professional & even cleaned up after themselves. They worked in perfect sync with each other throughout the installation and left my yard cleaner than when they arrived. I am AMAZED for such a huge project it only took a few short days from start to finish! Our system has been up and running now for a few months and I couldn't be happier! Neil or Sardar estimated our solar output exactly because, despite some cloudy days and cold-ish weather, the sun has thus far generated all the power we need without tapping into Edison's. My husband loves monitoring our solar production with the Enlighten app provided. Just one week after the installation, I was ecstatic to learn our carbon offset for that short period of time was 166 lbs, or the equivalent of 2 trees!! The solar panels and Enphase Inverters have a warranty of 25 years. Installation (workmanship) warranty is 10 years. IF anything should go wrong, we were instructed to call the office so they can come out and diagnose the problem. Please convey my thanks to the electrician from DRH Solar & Electric (with beard).

944,949,21143,"Overall very good experience with Invaleon both in terms of the system supplied and help and advice along the way.

Major points to note are:

1.Sales - Head of Sales (Sven) knows the city and utility company regulations and also the technical aspects of the systems. His advice can be relied on. More than can be said for many sales people in the solar power industry.

2. System Design - you can let Invaleon take all the decisions for you or work with the owner (Tom) to build a customised system. Tom is a technical whizz on solar and happy to sit down and discuss and explain the various options. Ours was a large customised system that none of the other suppliers seemed interested in discussing let alone supplying.

3. System Components - use SolarEdge -  DC optimisers and inverters -  and high quality LG panels. Company philosophy seems to be 'build to last'. Price was still competitive despite using top end components.

4. Timeliness - from signing the contract to switching on the system (with all permissions) - took about 4 weeks. There were no delays and Tom & Sven kept us informed on progress daily.

5. Roof Strengthening - if the roof structure is weak (ours clearly was and had worried me for some time) Invaleon can do the reinforcing themselves. No need to go elsewhere and no need to hire separate contractors.

6. Installation Crew - (headed by Frank) Direct employees not contractors so they have a stake in keeping you happy. Pleasant to deal with and responsive. All aspects of installation start with Frank saying, ""This is what we propose to do. Is that OK?"" If you have different ideas Frank accommodates them if technically possible. This is important. An aesthetically pleasing installation is rarely the easiest option for the installer but is key to maintaining property value. Key aspects are external conduit placement, inverter location and solar panel alignment and type. The team did an excellent job on all the above.

7. After Sales Service - Early days yet but all indications are that they don't just take your money after completion and then disappear. The monitoring system kept dropping out (fault of the phone company, Verizon,whose internet services are not the best and not a fault of the Invaleon install or Solar Edge hardware. Made no difference to power output so just annoying rather than anything else). Tom had noted the patchy connection when looking at the system output remotely and sent their IT expert Chris to swap the connection over to our Comcast network. Now running fine. Another After Sales consideration is that as technology evolves it's useful to be able to call on the original supplier for upgrades - eg battery backup for power outages. Tom has an interest in the industry and is up to date on the technology and willing to discuss future options.

Invaleon were initially selected because they were responsive, seemed technically well informed and were offering high-end components at a competitive price. Having said that, we were still nervous signing up because a solar electricity system is such a major purchase. As it turned out everything went well, the various people were a pleasure to deal with and we're now on track to a near-zero electricity bill. Full payback expected in 4 to 5 years.

945,950,1013,"As others have pointed out here, the customer service at Direct Energy is very spotty. During the couple of months to installation there was a lot of turnover at the company, and people I had earlier worked with suddenly had left the company. At times I had to push them to respond to emails or to set up meetings. Finally the lead project manager realized what was going on and took control of the situation. With him the process went much more smoothly and he was great to work with.

The installation team was top notch, and I was very impressed with their work. They were very professional and pleasant to deal with. Unlike the other review here, they cleaned up and left the house very orderly and tidy before finishing the project. It took a couple of follow up trips to troubleshoot and balance the system, but they did this very quickly to insure the system was working optimally. 

There are a lot of advantages with going with a larger company like Direct Energy, and in spite of my hit and miss customer service experience, I would go with them again. They clearly are still trying to integrate the solar company they absorbed (Astrum Solar) into their national operations, which probably explains the rough edges one still has to deal with.

Comparatively, for the cost, SolarUnion was a good one in our particular situation. They were able to meet our budget limitations, while having to go the extra mile in relocating an already pre-existing solar pool heater that was located on the roof where the new panels were to be installed. Agreeing to a quote from the original company that installed the solar pool heater would have cost me an additional $1,500 to relocate it.

Except for a cancellation on the original scheduled date for the installation of the new solar panels (because the foreman fell ill and had to go to the emergency room), everything went smoothly as planned. SolarUnion originally installed 33 panels, but had to remove 3 and settle for 30 panels because of city restrictions as it relates to escape routes in case of a fire.  Nevertheless, energy production produced by the 30 panels were adequate to met our energy needs.  

If not for the for the delay in the original installation causing us to miss work, I would have rated the company 5 stars. As it is, I would rate them 4.5 stars.  If you decide to go with this company, talk to Renzo.  I commend his professionalism.",4,0.7264
958,963,20030,"Was initially discouraged by the pressure tactics of solar companies until I met these guys earlier this year. The energy auditor gave me a bid and actually encouraged me to go out and keep comparing. He told me to compare value, quality and performance guarantees then come back to them. I have to acknowledge I had never been invited by a salesperson to stop the conversation right there, go out and compare, let alone in solar.

My only concern was the team’s ability to execute given a couple non-five star reviews I saw from earlier this year (I was in the market for a while), but the team has scaled up significantly. They were able to hit all milestones within five weeks.",5,0.5574

The truth is, Tim made some lofty promises about a Green Power Energy solar installation which included best pricing, best in class construction, best warranty, best equipment, and best customer service. From presentation to negotiation and painstaking follow up, Tim delivered.  Since you only install one Solar Energy Plant on your house you will want it done right, perfect, fast, and with as little intrusion on your daily life as possible.  I did a lot of research before I took the plunge in Solar.  I read the reviews, I checked credentials, and did a ton of due diligence.  I knew I needed to make the right decision on my provider and couldn't afford to make a mistake.

They began with consultation sessions that made sure the design was appropriately sized to our usage patterns and that it would maximize the savings we would receive relative to our expenditure.  They laid out a specific work plan and schedule, and adhered to it.  When we realized that an upgrade in electrical capacity would be needed, they included our personal electrician's efforts in the project plan so that it was an integrated effort.  They also handled all needed Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) and governmental approvals as well as all of the paperwork needed to obtain both the State of New Mexico and Federal tax credits. 

Once the installation was complete and the system turned on, they provided an online monitoring system that provides real-time tracking of the performance of all of the solar panels.  As it turned out, one out of our 41 panels was not functioning at the outset, but they identified and fixed the problem right away.  The system has now been in operation for almost six months and there have been no other problems.  However, if anything ever happens, we are confident that they will be right on top of it.  

As for monthly costs, we have been saving as much as $400 per month during the peak summer months, while in non-peak months the system is producing more power than we can use and which allow us to build up credits with PNM.  We project that we will effectively not have a monthly electric bill from PNM (except for about $11 in certain unavoidable fixed charges) during at least half the months of the year.

1062,1067,21729,"Hello Kevin,
I am a retired school teacher and have discovered that I could do
something to help my family and I contribute to saving money, and
protect against some of the price rises that are impacting us all.
It is wonderful that you are considering installing a solar hot water
system in your home. I had my Secusol system installed in September of
2011. So far the system works great.  All work was completed as
promised it took one day and if I had any concerns or questions, Dave
and Bruce were more than willing to go the extra mile to answer or
deal with them. I asked numerous questions and both gentlemen were
very attentive and timely in answering them either by email or phone.
I was quoted a price and  had a review of the installation placement
and procedure. Just feel free to ask. Bruce, John  and Dave will do their
best to give you a complete answer. The system as mentioned previously
works well. Very interesting to see the solar working more and more as
the season went from winter to spring. More daylight hours equals more
fuel oil savings because my oil fire heat and hot water system fires
less often. I hope to save at least 125 gallons of oil to heat my hot
water during the year. No servicing issues as of yet. After a few
years you might need to change the anode in the tank. Not a big
expense. I can say that NESHW is a efficient, well run company from my
experience thus far. The German made system has the complete 10 year
warranty. I  completed my income taxes and the Federal 30% tax credit
and the state 15% credit was great to apply for savings in my budget.
You will need to follow up on some of the paperwork that is required.
It was not a big problem for me. Bruce or Dave I am sure will provide
guidance.
The 0% loan was obtained from BayCoast Bank. I had to up front $500.00
to begin the process. The $1135 CEC rebate was granted very quickly.
So, I was not out of pocket to long. I borrowed $6700 and the monthly
payment is $79.76. I know my Weil McClain oil burner is firing much
less to keep my water hot.April, May, June, July, August,
September.really looking forward to the hot water production.
.Kevin the system continues to work without issues,through 2015. Best
hot water productions continues to be during the months mention. Then
in November my boiler works more to provide heat for the house. So it
runs for the heat and hot water is produced also. So it barely runs
during 6 months is working for heat. Savings continues to be about 125
to 150 gallons of oil used per year.
Our citizens need to evaluate new and proven technology to help  move
us forward towards energy independence and create a more sustainable
and renewable place for all of us.Keep moving forward.
I hope this information has been of some help.
Sincerely,

I got the micro inverter system and am very pleased with the performance of the entire system.  
The kit was complete down to the end caps that close off the railings.  The railing system is designed to carry the ground throughout the system so the ground wire only has to go from the end panel to the service panel ground. 
The AP systems micro inverter monitoring is excellent.  I have the choice of monitoring with computer software, their website through the internet or a mobile app.
kWh output production is updated every 15 minutes and can be broken down to 5 min. increments for each individual panel.  I can clearly see where and when my shading issues are for one particular panel.

I asked if and when they might plan to have a Battery Backup option. They informed my of the 7600 Watt Inverter that has the battery option. Unfortunately, I needed the the 10K Inverter and with the Net Meetering Cap met in Massachusetts, I could not get approval for anything above 10K. They also do not disclose if and when they might include expansion of my Inverter to support a Battery.

I feel that they need to support their customer base and be more responsive to their customer's inquiries. They should be able to give a general answer to this question.

I was pleased with their Solar Energy App for monitoring the power produced. The monitoring they provided was great, but I was surprised they were high by a very consistent ""3.8%. The support person explained that it isn't a ""revenue grade meter"" and therefore could be +- 10%.

Installation was relatively good, failed inspection twice, but minor issues.  Don't pay utility bills at least 9 mos out of year, large install 58 panels.  Issue is customer service after the install.  Getting worse with direct energy.  Understaffed, takes at least 6 weeks to get inverters replaced, customer support overwhelmed, dependent on Enphase to get them parts, do not stock.  Repair staff is 1-2 people, one gets injured or out of office and leadtime doubles.  Don't even know when someone has been out here  and then takes a week to turn the new inverter on.  Large turnover in staff.  Seem to be great in selling the install, and doing the install.  Recommended to two other friends based on that.  Would not recommend based on service.  Keep saying they will fix staffing and inventory parts to shorten lead time, does not happen.  Direct energy cuts staff.  I have complained, escalated, and nothing works.  4 inverters out in the past year.  Enphase does NOT monitor even though they are suppose to.   I have brought EVERY downed inverter to their attention, so I have to daily monitor myself.  Never brought one to my attention.  If you don't monitor you won't get it fixed.  They say they will reimburse us for lost energy.  Very short sighted.  The $25-$30 they are reimbursing me is costing them thousands as they are never seeing another referral.

Did they come to me to discuss the difference or admit they made a mistake and try to fix it? No, they went behind my back and tried to register a 24 panel system with the NJ SREC program without my knowledge and hoped I wouldn't notice. When I asked them about the discrepancy, they lied to me. I confronted them and they tried to convince me to sign a new contract with them for a 24 panel system. I refused and asked for my deposit ($10,450) to be refunded because they were dishonest with me. After over 50 emails and phone calls they finally agreed to refund my money by a certain date, that date came and went and I never received my money back. They came up with one excuse after another e.g. you have to wait 30 days until the refund is issued, we need a certified letter, the check is on the CFO's desk but not signed, the CFO is out this week, etc. They took great pleasure in giving me the run-around, not returning my phone calls, transferring me to a number that  either rang forever or prompted me to leave a message that was never returned, accepting my call and pretending they couldn't hear me or calling me back on my home phone number when I left my mobile phone number, etc. The entire office seems to be staffed by people that think it's acceptable to tell lies if they are being paid to do it. It was only after I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, NJ Division of Consumer Affairs and the PA Attorney General among others that I finally got my money back.

Some of my other issues with KISS is that they required 90% of the total cost of the project paid before anything was delivered to my house or any work was done at all and that they didn't provide me with a copy of the contract I signed until I insisted on it.

After more than 3 weeks, I attempted to reach her. After leaving several phone and e-mail messages, she finally called me and said she didn’t know what was happening and would get back to me.

Again I heard nothing. So I called the person at the main office again and was told that they were not going to do our project. I asked why and was told that he didn’t know and would get back to me with the information. 

After not hearing back from him, we got in touch with someone at Energy Sage. She called the company and was told that someone would get back to us with the information about why they canceled our project. After a number of follow up requests on our part, no one has yet gotten back to us.

The month between when the led's, water heater were installed and solar were installed our bill dropped around 17% over last year. Once ONCOR was finished tasking its sweet ass time and turn the panels on things got exciting. I got on green mountain's buy back program and after 1 cycle, the next bill was -$34... 

The only negative was getting solar edge monitoring up and running. I don't know why it has to be so complicated. 

Either way Circle L is a-ok in my book.

1177,1182,20778,"I've been researching going solar for 2 years. After contacting the 6 highest rated solar companies that I found on an independent website that rates the top 100 companies in the nation in a variety of fields, I still had no panels for my townhouse. 

Four of the companies disqualified me right over the phone while talking to me, due to the size and shape of my roof. One, Blue Raven Solar, at least sent 2 reps over to my house. They never went up to my roof, never took any measurements, never even looked at my circuit breaker box in the basement. The only thing one of them did was take a picture of the large tree in my neighbors back yard, that was a potential sunlight blocker, and tell me what a great and wonderful company they were, and that they'd get back to me.  But they never did, not even after I emailed them again right after their visit to my house. They did not even show the professionalism to respond to my email.

Solar city on the other hand did send a real engineer. He looked at my electrical system. He went up on my roof and took measurements and sunlight shade readings. They tried to make a system that would produce 50% of my electric needs. But a few days later they pulled out too, when they couldn't put the minimal 8 panels on my roof, due to NY state laws that require 2 ft of clear roof space along the parameter of your roof for fire fighters. They I cannot say anything against. They simply weren't equipped to outfit a home like mine, but they really did try and kept me informed throughout the whole process.

Then came Leandro Salvatico from SustenCorp.  He custom designed a system for my impossible to fit roof that would hold FOURTEEN yes fourteen solar panels. It was innovative and is hardly noticeable when you stand in front of my house. It was a marvelous creation by Leandro.

  My electric bills which average around $135  a month, dropped the last 3 months to - $15, $18, and $38. His engineer David Lam who did the entire installation, saw through all the bugs that cropped up. And there were several, but he never stopped till he fixed each one, and I got the great production I'm getting now.

After speaking with Jeremiah, he arrived at my home, on time as agreed.  He also utilized a ""quad copter"" with a video downlink to obtain aerial footage of my home.  Out of the other 15 quotes I received, no other company came as prepared as Jeremiah.  After conducting business checks, Better Business Bereu checks, responding to their office to meet other employees and view their business, I elected to entertain his contract.  Jeremiah was always punctual when returning my calls!  Nevertheless, after reviewing all of the aforementioned information, I was unable to reveal anything negative about Solar Gain Inc.

I decided to sign the contract with Solar Gain Inc after the extensive review.

The install:
I had numerous on site appointments with Solar Gain Inc..  It should be noted that they were punctual and contacted me prior to the appointment if there was a minor delay.  As the install began, I noted the employees were humble and respectful, often addressing me as ""sir.""  The install was completed in a CLEAN manner, rising questions from surrounding neighbors.  The inverter was installed inside of my garage to protect it from the elements.  The panels are flush mounted on a tile roof at 18 degrees.  Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the overall service, interaction with the employees and the final product.  After the install was completed, a inspection was requested through our town.  The inspector arrived and complemented on the cleanliness of the install, including ""service loops"" at all connections.  My install passed the first inspection with the town.  Next, they scheduled the local power to inspect the install.  I was baffled when I returned home from work three days after the town inspection and a green tag was on my door from the power company.  It informed me that my photovoltaic system was operational with meters in place.  Next I powered the system up and was immediately operational.

After viewing installs and reading reviews from other LARGER and SMALLER companies (I will not specify to save embarrassment), I was exhilarated with my overall experience!

This review was completed voluntarily without compensation.

If you wish to have great communication, immediate returned telephone calls, a clean installation, humble and respectful employees arriving at your home, immediate results from your photovoltaic system, I would recommend Solar Gain Inc (Tucson, AZ completed my install) without hesitation.  I was in NO WAY regretful of hiring Solar Gain Inc to complete my installation.

My neighbor has some steadily growing Italian Cypress that will eventually throw some shadow onto my panels in another 10 years or so, so I specifically asked that the panels be placed to minimize that.  I worked with the designer to locate the panels on the roof accordingly.  However, when the day of installation came, the guys on the roof thought it would look better to place the panels in a location not called out in the design, right where the future shadows will be.  They called to ask if that was OK, but I was at work, so it took several calls to get them to adhere to the original placement plan.  Situation eventually solved.  Then, when it came to routing the wires from the roof into the distribution panel, I discovered that they planned to put surface mounted conduit on the interior walls of the pantry in my kitchen (where the dist panel is located)!  Not good.  So I had to intervene and ask that they cut open the drywall and route the wires so that they would be hidden.  Their lead installer agreed, and did exactly as I asked.  Great results.

As competitive as the solar energy market is for providers, SolarTech was by far the best choice to go with when it came to cost, quality of their product, knowledge of their product, and legendary customer service. I knew little to nothing when it came to solar energy systems for residential homes prior to my venture with SolarTech. The people at SolarTech were phenomenal; educating me on everything there is to know about solar energy systems. I went with the 9.8kw Sunpower system and it has done wonders for my SDG&E bill, $15 a month! Ali was extremely helpful and made himself available throughout the installation process, he was there every step of the way. Ali also helped me with a 200 amp. panel upgrade, I highly recommend this! SolarTech's project manager Grant was also helpful and available during the installation process from start to finish.

1283,1288,1013,"Our professional relationship with Direct Energy Solar in Massachusetts has been mixed. Sales and installation were excellent. SERVICE TO FIX POST PRODUCTION ISSUES IS TERRIBLE! I did not want to write this review but now feel required to warn other people. The initial sales and installtion process was a five star rating. Since I have been upable to produce any solar energy for 6 weeks withut getting any Service, my overall rating is a one star. I spent a lot of money for the installation and am getting NOTHING out of it right now. 
Our Sales and Installation processes was wonderful and possibly best in class. The salesman, Steve Swindell, gave us plenty of time and helped educate us on the whole solar process. He was fantasic and the primary reason we selected Direct Energy over the other companies with which we talked. The installation team was fantastic. They had some issues with local building inspection and electical inspecton requirements and smoothly cleared these issues quickly. John Daly was a great installation project lead, 
The system worked like a charm from July through mid-Novmeber. Our electric bills were zero (producing more energy than we used) through September and minor (10% of original) in October. 
Then we had to deal with the Service Department!!! THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! In mid-November our system stopped working. I reported this to Direct Energy, after finding it myself on November 24, 2016. They added us to the Service request queue. As I write this on December 26, 2016, we still have not seen a service person or even had a service date scheduled. I have called them a number of times and still do not have any service date. This is ridiculous. My gut feel is that the company focus is on installations since that is where the cash flow comes from. They have insufficient resources dedicated to service and repair. 
BE WARNED.. .YES ,THEY SUPPLY SERVICE AS THEY STATE (I PRESUME). I AM JUST NOT SURE WHEN THE SERVICE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPP{EN. I will be lucky to get any service for a non-functioning system in the SAME YEAR that I requested it. BAD, BAD, BAD. This is pathetic.

I further discovered that the amount I was quoted by Sunergy was almost exactly what I would receive in payments over the 15 year net metering agreement my power company was offering.  Initially on paper the deal looks great- no cost to me and the system is paid off 10 years before the end of the 25 year life of the panels.  The problem is that other companies quoted a far lower cost for the system so that it would paid off in 7-8 years, leaving me with 6-7 years of net metering income in addition to the remaining 10 years of life in the panels.  What tipped me off was that when I hesitated to sign an agreement on the first visit from the Sunergy sales rep, he offered a large cash ""advertising"" incentive and then also offered to replace my entire roof at no cost before the panels were installed.

1293,1298,20699,"As a fan of being self-sufficient, I’ve wanted to “go solar” for quite a long time … and … I had been doing quite a bit of online research --on both wind~ and solar-systems-- since 2008, when I moved into my current home, just north of Omaha, NE.  I don’t remember exactly “when” I came across EnergyONE Solar (EOS) as a source for getting my panels, but one day, while on Facebook, I went ahead and clicked on their link, to see what they had to offer.  As someone that deals with web design day-to-day, I found EOS’s website to be very thoughtful and informative … and … logically laid-out.  So, with all of my previous research into solar power, I made the inquiry into getting an estimate from them for my home. Shortly thereafter, I discovered the fact that EnergyONE Solar’s CEO, Dustin, was actually from Nebraska … and had gone to high school, near Omaha, with one of my cousins.  We immediately hit it off and he made me feel very assured on “how” my 40-panel system installation (and financing) could be/would be handled.  Everyone I talked to at EnergyONE Solar was very knowledgeable and responsive to my questions and concerns—especially since EOS “claimed” Nebraska as part of their territory but had not completed many installations (“up here”) up to this time.  It was to my surprise that EnergyONE Solar went that “extra step” and sought out a local (to my town) electrical-install company and trained them on how to install my EOS-designed system … AND … further, completed this training in such a timely manner that I “got” all of the monetary incentives available to me for the calendar year of 2016—BRAVO, EnergyONE Solar!  I now also get the additional bonus of having a “local” company/technician on hand should I have any future questions regarding maintenance, cleaning, or any other question concerning *my* system that I could think of—this is REALLY a “Win-Win-Win” in my book!  I am now happily “showing off” my 11.4 kWh (peak) system to interested friends and family here in Eastern Nebraska … as well as getting the satisfaction of watching my power meter “run backwards!”  Thank you, EnergyONE Solar!",5,0.9476

After meeting with the sales associate Shawn, who did a great job explaining the TCO and benefits around solar, we decided to move forward with GreenBrilliance. She walked us through the timeline and what to expect next, including assistance with getting approval from our HOA to put panels on our townhouse and the ordering of our US-made panels.

Admittedly, the design process did take longer than expected with multiple back and forth communications.  However, that was because we were also moving the location of our roof vents and had to involve our roofer. Furthermore, we were utilizing a home energy audit company to make improvements to our home for energy efficiency simultaneously. In any case, GB was committed to providing a way to maximize the output and number of panels. Armen supplied a design spec that we used for our HOA paperwork. The design process did not hold up our install, which needed to take place before the end of the year..

Sharmila, the office manager, provided solid communication and flexibility in scheduling the date of installation and delivery of materials. Upon delivery, a representative was sent to check over and inventory the equipment ahead of the install to ensure everything was there.  We really appreciated that thoroughness so that installation was not delayed.

The install itself went smoothly and the crew came when we expected and was diligent about completing the solar array install. Even after the fact, GB sent a team back to take pictures since we couldn’t get a clear picture on our own to ensure that the SREC paperwork process was a breeze.

Shankar helped with the county inspection or our electrical components related to the solar install.

1324,1329,20054,I have been very impressed with Green Power Energy. They have been completely consistent through sales and installation and their service has been flawless. They showed great integrity and communication throughout the project which came online yesterday... I was originally going to proceed with a large national company. I had started the process with them but became frustrated with their attention to detail during the design phase... I called Green Power back and switched to them. I am so  glad I did so! These guys know the industry inside out and can answer any question you may have... I am really excited to see my 12.6Kw system online! ,5,0.7717
1325,1330,21309,"I can say without reservation that everyone I've dealt with at Apex is knowledgeable, ambitious and  hard working.  They have an excellent staff throughout the entire organization and they seem to enjoy what they are doing.  Each person with every interaction has seemed to go beyond the call of duty and do whatever was necessary to assure a good customer experience.  Sadly, I've come to expect poor customer service to be normal from most companies.  I'm happy to say this is NOT the case with the Apex organization.  They also seem to work well as a team, calling upon each others knowledge and experience as needed and in some cases working with the hardware/software manufacturer to solve problems.

Apex put in a multi building solar panel 18KW+ system with high density panels and normal density panels.  This should give us a net zero energy farm (2 horses, 4,000 sq ft+ house and geothermal HVAC system).  The system was a little complicated as the solar panels went on two barn roofs with underground conduits between the 2 barns and house and hardware needed in all 3 buildings including internet communication for remote monitoring and diagnostics.  The communication could not go by wireless phone as we do not have a Verizon signal out here.

Our HVAC geothermal system uses a lot of energy as it is nearly always pumping water from the ground to run the system.  This caused us to put in a larger system than originally anticipated for this new construction site.

Apex did an excellent job. Great coordination with us, National Grid, the builders, the town,  etc.  We're extremely happy with the system.

There was a technical glitch about 10 months after the initial installation. There was an arc fault in the system which caused the system to error out (properly for safety sake).  The problem was intermittent and difficult to diagnose.  In the end one of the hundreds of connectors in the system was not fully inserted until it went ""click"".  A number of technicians came out over a period of weeks and spent many hours here until the problem was found.  To my pleasant surprise Apex cut me a check for the lost electrical production.  I believe they were not obligated to do this.  I think the agreement says they are NOT responsible for lost production.  They simply did the right thing without our request.

Recently (about 3 months after the above problem) they discovered that the system has not been monitored by the Solar Edge on line monitoring system.  They discovered the problem through their own remote monitoring of their customers' systems and sent a tech out today to fix this problem.  The initial problem was a simple reboot to the router (not really an Apex problem).  While the technician was here he updated the software in the controllers (made by Solar Edge) and helped me to better understand the modems and routers in my house and barns and how to optimize the signals used by the solar equipment and also all of our home networked electronics.  Again.  Excellent customer service, beyond the call of duty.

HOT WATER,  This was something that was not pushed on the sales side by Apex, but was requested by us after researching the topic. Their sales seems geared toward the solar. But the hot water system was a natural companion to the solar arrays.  We have a hot water system on our roof.  It has a payback which is faster than the electrical panels.  In my opinion, this type of system should work for almost any house.  Apex has a small subset of people who are expert in the hot water systems.

A few weeks after the hot water system was installed, I noticed late on a Saturday afternoon that some of the insulation inside the house had melted on the pipes.  I sent out an Email and got an immediate response.  Someone came out first thing Monday morning.  The wrong type of insulation, I can say without reservation that everyone I've dealt with at Apex is knowledgeable, ambitious and  hard working.

We got to look the estimates over on our time and decided to go with IES Texas Solar, which we can tell you that was the best decision that we could have ever made. From the first time that we spoke with Brandon to the last time, we felt like he had us covered. Every question, every concern was answered promptly without feeling like we were bothering anyone. They sent us a proposal with pictures and information about what we were getting, which turned out 100% like the proposed system. None of the ""by the way we could not do this"" or ""sorry we need to add this"" which could raise the cost. We wanted a turnkey system that looks great and that is absolutely what we got. We have a few houses around us with solar panels and none looks as great as ours. We DO NOT have pipes running all over the roof or crooked panels like some the other homes that we see. IES handled all the paper work, homeowners association, permits, tax forms and the CPS rebate (which we received in less than a month). The day of the install went just as smooth, they showed up right on time and were gone before we knew it. Thank you to all the workers that worked hard to install our PV system.

There was no haggling/negotiating just a low price up front. Plain and simple.  
My wife and I had met with one other company (Vision Solar), and they were a very high-pressured sales team, which we did not appreciate.

When he asked for changes, they were made promptly and the revised plans were quickly sent to us.  

The installation was done quickly in just a couple of days.  The crew was courteous and cleaned up all their detritus each day.

Their management of the process, the financial elements of the deal, their customer service, their guarantees, their follow up, all of it was an exceptional experience.  I actually took the time to write both the CEO, the VP of Marketing and the VP of Operations to compliment them all.

1381,1386,3250,"We have a multigenerational household, and with our attached ""Grandparent's Unit"" it is essentially a 2600 sq. ft duplex.  We also have a pool and spa that runs 24-7.  We use a lot of electricity!  Our monthly electric bill, on the yearly ""even pay plan"" was about $600 a month.  I had looked in to getting Solar with other companies, but our overall electric bill with their offerings was only going to be lowered by about $50 a month.  I found Sungevity to be above and beyond the rest in customer service, and in application.  I never had a salesman come to my home, or pressure me.  Endless questions and concerns were answered fully by our Sungevity representative.  We wanted as much of our power as possible to come from Solar...without unsightly panels showing on the front of our South facing home. Sungevity was able to show us what our home would look like with the panels installed, and give us a pretty accurate assessment of our energy savings.  The installers sent by Sungevity were excellent. Now, with 72 panels on our roof, none showing from the street view, almost all of our electric energy is supplied by the sun.  We pay $354 a month for Sungevity's lease, and a few dollars more to the electric company for taxes and fees.  We are saving about $200 a month.  Much of the year we are supplying energy to the grid and banking those kWh for later use.  In addition, Sungevity provides a wonderful website that allows us to keep a close track of our panels' production, as well as an estimate of the greenhouse gasses we are eliminating by going solar.

1385,1390,20383,"I really appreciated Great Sky's dedication to putting together a system that would work in circumstances typically avoided by the giants, who prefer cookie-cutter installations. I had minimal southern exposure (but as it turned out, very serviceable western exposure) and a municipal power company where I believe I was one of the first ten customers to make use of a newly introduced net metering policy. My electrical usage is very modest (about 2.4 MWh annually). In addition my application fell into a period of uncertainty for SREC II. Despite these apparently discouraging factors, Great Sky created proposals grounded in measurements taken from my roof, worked with my muni to understand their policies and meet their particular requirements, and kept me apprised of the evolving SREC II environment. Installation was professional and sensitive to appearances (even to the point of painting outside electrical conduit to match different trim and wall colors behind it!).

I was very anxious to keep on top of any responsibilities I had to make sure the project moved forward and was executed properly, but in fact, Great Sky pretty much did it all for me. As anticipated, the system generated its first MWh in the first quarter of operation, and everything is set up to auction the associated SREC and deposit proceeds automatically. Most months my electrical bill is a credit that offsets some of my gas bill (from the same municipal power company).

It was a bonus that the company is local, small, and looking to do the right thing, and not some outfit just looking to make a quick buck in the MA market.",4,0.9072

1415,1420,3250,"I had 2 panel installation projects.  Although the deal sounded great, it seemed to good to be true, there had to be a catch.  I had panels installed on my barn and I was told it would generate about 58% of what I had been using.  The installer was great, no issues at all.  After 6 months I found the panels and the contract exceeded my expectations.  There was no ""catch"".  What really impressed me was a call I received about 6 months after the first installation.  A sungevity representative told me that my panels were not generating.  I was unaware.  I gave them the error code on the inverter display and they scheduled a repair.  The panels were off line for about 2 weeks total and they credited me the time they were off line.  You typically see the problems with a company when you have problems like that with their product. That was the easiest I have ever dealt with a vendor.  They told me of the problem, fixed the problem, and credited me for the down time.  With that I ordered a 2nd installation for the garage roof.  The two leases combined are $3 LESS than what had been my average electric bill prior to either installation AND I generate positive for the year.  In fact last April was the anniversary of my 2nd installation (and the point where I began generating positive), and the local power company sent me cash back for the over production.  I am told there is no such ""cash back"" possibility with solar city panels.   
The installation of the my panels by Sungevity was an excellent move for multiple reasons.  First; it clearly helps the environment.  It also helps the US to be less dependent on foreign oil, which harms this country politically and economically.  Finally there is the money: $3/month savings doesn't sound like much, but when you consider that the lease does not go up each year (as does the local power rate), that savings is a steady increase.  Prior to my first installation I  graphed my expenditures for the lease vs. power company assuming no increase in the sungevity lease and a steady power company increase based upon their historic rate hikes.  The savings was around $30,000 over the 20 year lease!!  Note that was before the 2nd installation, so I am sure that number is even greater now.
Executive summary: unless you live in a cave or have no sunshine, I recommend you have panels installed by Sungevity as soon as possible. ",5,0.8689
1416,1421,3250,"1/24/17- It has been just over two years since the switch was turned on for our 9000 KWh solar power system (36 panels) and we couldn't be happier.  Since this happened in December we still had to buy some kWhs for a while until we started producing more than what we needed during the spring and summer.  Now that we have made a couple full year cycles I can tell you that for the last 22 months the only thing we have paid National Grid  is the $17.35 monthly delivery charge (unfortunately we can't get rid of this without a huge battery to store our excess power supply for the winter months).   I think just knowing we are solar makes us try to be more cautious about the amount of energy that we are using and thus our usage went down.    Before you head down this path, make sure you are prepared to stay organized.  I kept track of every conversation, who I spoke to, and every phone# as this process is tedious and you need to stay on top of things.  You will need to take some time off to be there for certain parts of the process.  This was the only difficult part ... as the crew (contracted by Sungevity) who installed our system cancelled on us 3 times. (once for 2 sick guys and a broken down van, once for the death of a family member and once a no show)  Sungevity did reimburse us $300 for the inconvenience.  The day they finished putting the solar panels on our roof was a nasty/snowy/rainy day.  The crew worked until 6:30 pm with flood lights on our house.  I was extremely concerned about their safety as none of the workers were tied off to anything and I told our project manager about this to hopefully prevent anyone from getting hurt in the future.    Once the system is up and running there is nothing to do but sit back and watch the kWhs accumulate.  You can easily go online and see by the hour how much you are producing.  You will need to get in touch with your power company after you get a better understanding of your monthly production  to confirm when you would like your ""anniversary date"" to be.  That is the month in which the power company will buy back from you any additional kWh that you have produced over the last year (if you have any at all).  We selected March as that is the month in which we (in Oswego, NY) started producing more kWhs than what we are using.  Don't think you are going to make any $ on this buyback.  Last year National Grid only paid us 2 cents for each extra kWh we produced. That is $16.00 for 800 kWHs,   In NY we had to fill out a form to prevent our real estate tax rate from increasing due to the value of the solar panels.  This exemption is good for 15 years. Also, since Sungevity gets the 30% solar Federal tax credit (as we are just leasing the system for 20 years), we were only able to claim the 25% NY state tax credit on our income taxes.  But, this is definitely $'s off the total cost of the system in the long run.  Beware, sometimes you won't produce any kWhs if you have snow partially covering any of the panels.  I thought the system wasn't working properly but they said this can happen depending on which panels are covered.  Given how things are going, it should only take us about 7 years to recoup the $ we put into purchasing the panels.  One last thing, I can honestly say that every Sungevity employee I had the opportunity to deal with was extremely helpful throughout the entire process.  Thanks especially to my Project Manager Brad McDonald for always being there when I needed an answer!  ",5,0.8357

I am still paying about what I was paying without the solar panels and in some months more..  I was promised that along with the $73. that is deducted from my account each month I would sometimes get a bill from the utility co. for $5 or $6.  I have never received a utility bill that low.  They range from $17 to $45.  Sungevity based their estimations on my previous bills and nothing has changed in my household.  I've complained several times and have been told things would improve,  but they only get worse.  In my opinion, they only one who benefits from this system is Sungevity.",1,-0.6187
1423,1428,3250,"I've always been jealous of people who could afford to put solar panels on their house, but could never afford the cost of panels.  But Sungevity gave us the option to basically lease the panels.  They paid to install the panels and maintain them (another plus), for flat fee.  The installation went smoothly - the guys were great.   The panels now cover 40% of our electricity needs over the course of a New England Year - and that cost will not go up.   While we still have a National Grid electricity bill, it is much lower, especially in the summer when we run the air conditioner.  Overall we are paying slightly less than we did before we installed the panels, and feel good about doing something for the environment, without using up all our savings or going into debt to do so. And our savings will go up as National Grid increases their rates.  ",5,0.6249

1430,1435,3250,"I'm a mechanical engineer, so I like to know exactly how things work.  The sales staff was very helpful with answering my questions, and I'm satisfied with the results.  I was looking at first to install a system myself, but what made me go with Sungevity was that they do all the permit work, take care of the install, warranty on equipment as well as against roof damage, AND their production guarantee.  These things are well worth the extra couple thousand it cost in labor, and I'm sure I saved myself 6 months of trying to build it myself (with a qualified Electrical contractor for service tie-in).  My system has been up for over a year, and the production has exceeded the projection.  The app is nice for tracking production as well.  Sungevity even emailed me a notice that my local utility company was phasing out a rate schedule that would be to my advantage with the solar production.  I was able to switch to that rate schedule before the utility company ended new customers for it.  All around I've had a good experience, and I'm looking forward to paying nothing for energy for the next 19+ years while rates continue to increase. I'm also pleased that Sungevity is big enough not to disappear in 10 years.  A warranty or production guarantee is only good as long as the company exists.
As a side note, I priced out a local solar installer for an equivalent system, and it would have cost about $1000 more...without the production guarantee or roof damage warranty.",5,0.7964

1434,1439,3250,"The title says it all.  Sungevity installed my home solar panel system about two years ago and my only regret is that I didn't do it sooner.  Sungevity did a great job walking me through every step of the design and installation.  They responded to every question quickly and I always felt like I knew what was going on.  The system works great and my annual electrical bill is almost $0.00.  And before anyone asks about this review:  no, I don't work for Sungevity, I don't own stock, and I don't know anyone in the company.  I am just a happy customer.

Bonus points to Sungevity, by the way, for fixing a part of the system that someone else broke.  About a year after the solar panel installation, my utility provider here in San Diego had to switch out part of their gear that interfaces with the solar panel inverter.  The utility company's electrician incorrectly connected the utility equipment to the inverter and my power generation wasn't feeding to the grid.  Long-story short:  I repeatedly called the utility company and their electrician to fix their problem and no luck.  I called Sungevity and asked for their help (again, even though it was not their problem!) and Sungevity contacted the original electrician that installed the solar panel system, he showed up, and fixed it.  No questions asked.  No invoices.  Just fixed.  Sungevity was only interested in one thing:  customer satisfaction, even a year after they finished their project, by fixing something that wasn't their fault.  Thanks!  ",5,0.7819

Each month I get via e-mail a report on how the system is performing and have past reports available 7/24.

Unfortunately the weather has not cooperated  thus far this winter. We are still paying more for power than we were before solar. I still believe it will be better Someday? To be honest we are in a lease program, and I am including the cost of the lease. If we were able to purchase outright I think we would be very happy. However, having said that, the sales folks told us they GUARANTEED our bills would be smaller. So as of the end of the third year if wedon't see a significant improvement we will go back know the the solar company and have them either reduce the lease payment or take it off our home.

1440,1445,20161,"During the early stages of requesting web-based proposals from installers for my home solar PV system in northern NJ (through the Energy Sage website), I felt that Sumintra differentiated itself through its direct, honest, personalized approach and the knowledge and courtesy of its principal, Anil Babooram.   Anil took the time to educate me on various aspects of PV systems, components and installation, answered my questions and even offered information and guidance on things I needed to know or do after installation (technically not part of his job).  This approach carried through to his on-site visit, where I noted his diligence, patience and attention to detail.  After selecting Sumintra, I was pleased to discover that the contract was concise, simple and straightforward, very easy to deal with.  When they arrived to begin installation, it was clear that they weren’t going to simply “slap it on and be gone” in 3 days.  Anil formulated a well-thought-out plan and he and his crew executed it with meticulous attention to detail, using the most durable equipment, constructed/installed with personalized attention to the quality of the work.  We benefitted from Anil’s presence on site every day, planning and overseeing the work while doing part of the installation himself.  Anil is extremely conscientious and is a pleasure to have around, both personally and professionally; he treated each aspect of our project as if his own professional qualifications and credibility were at stake.  His crew was courteous and diligent as well.

1482,1487,21127,"Taitem responded promptly to our request for a quote through EnergySage but also expressed a desire to visit the property so they could refine their quote based on actual conditions rather than through a location analysis from a GPS Map.  That gave me a positive feel for their desire to do this  right - no other responder suggested a visit.  The engineer who visited and conducted an extensive evaluation was very friendly and knowledgeable, and spent time discussing the process, all the various options for paying for the installation, and how the actual installation would be done if we chose to go forward.  Taitem provided three quotes for different types of installation related to the efficiency of the panels, the warranties on both the panels and their efficiency over time, etc.  These included tax credit amounts, payback time frames, and amounts due at each point in  the planning, filing and installation process.
Taitem was very patient through the process of our financing the installation and the wait for  the bank check to clear for one of the payments.
The installation itself went very well. The installers worked hard to run necessary wiring through  interior chases in the walls from our attic to the crawl space below the house, ensuring that nothing was visible within the house (except for the entry point in the attic) and exterior wiring was minimal and only at the point where required panels were installed outside.  Installation was very professional and neat - installers were even picking up  the small insulation pieces from the wiring as the connections moved along.  There was only a very short period when power had to be shut down while connections were made and the installers explained what they were doing throughout the installation. 
Once work was complete, Taitem made all the arrangements for the Utility Company to change the meter to reflect power flowing back to the utility company. The engineer returned to walk us though the system installed, how to monitor the system through our computer, what to do in case of a grid power failure, etc.  They also provided a thumb drive with all documents, plans, and information about the system.  We felt very comfortable through the entire process.
Our installation took place at the end of September, 2016, but NYSEG's meter switch didn't occur for a couple of weeks, so our use of the system began about the middle of  October, 2016, close to the time when the amount of sunlight starts to decrease with shortened days and more cloudy skies.  Even so, I reviewed the system online just before writing this review on 1/31/2017 and found that since the system was turned on, 66.7% of our electricity has come from our solar panels.  Today is a cloudy day with snow flurries and even with that interference with sunlight, as of 12:30 pm we are producing 133% of our energy use - meaning we are still feeding electricity back to the grid.  Since we went live, the system shows we have saved 1467 lbs of CO2 emissions.  Our monthly electrical bills have been reduced by more than half, and we anticipate a further refund from NYSEG when our anniversary date arrives.  We are extremely pleased with the installation, our reduced use of  fossil fuel and resultant emissions, and particularly with Taitem Engineering. ",5,0.6249

In fact, dealing with Damon W. and his crew was the easiest thing I have ever done with regards to any work on my houses. They are hands down professionally laid back and super efficient. I looked at other solar companies and to be honest they were a rip off and I was told it would take 6 months to be up and running. If I recall it was 4 weeks or so and one day I went to work and when I came home I had solar installed and with a couple of weeks after town and state inspections we were fully up and running.

1559,1564,452,"To add to the chorus of negative reviews of Solar City's aggressive/deceptive business tactics: On our first in-person meeting, the sales rep said that in order to work up a detailed proposal for my solar system, I'd have to sign a contract right away - which, he assured me, was completely changeable, nothing final; he knew that I was still gathering estimates from other potential installers, nothing here was binding, etc. When I, very stupidly, expressed willingness to sign, he flipped through the document on his computer to bring me straight to the places I was to sign, i.e. did not show me the whole contract (much less encourage me to read it); very exceedingly stupidly, I signed where I was told without insisting on seeing more. (I do not come off well in this story either, I admit.)

A few days later, I sent him an e-mail asking to change our next meeting to a later date, to which he agreed - adding, ""Have you had time to fully read the contract you signed?"" This struck me as both an odd thing to say in the context AND a good idea, so I went back and read it - and discovered that indeed, the contract could be changed or cancelled, but with a $250 fee if done more than 10 business days after being signed. To my mind, his failure to mention this fee in our initial meeting pushed his already-aggressive selling tactics into the realm of deception; even worse, he continued to pointedly not mention the fee even while changing the date of our meeting to past the 10-day window, thus ensuring that I'd have to pay $250 if I ended up wanting to cancel. In my first un-stupid act of the whole episode, I immediately cancelled the contract, and will have nothing more to do with them.  

Since these aggressive/deceptive tactics are exactly what all the negative online reviews say about Solar City as a whole, it seems to me that this must be their corporate strategy - the sales reps are actively trained to do this sort of thing. I encourage everyone to avoid them, and spread the word - friends don't let friends get duped by Solar City!

We got 1/3 of the cost back from the federal government, and we are basically driving to and from work without using any gas, since we bought plug-in cars. We are very happy with our solar panels, which we expect to have paid off in twelve to fifteen years. We spent $44,000 upfront, but will get $13,000 back in federal government rebates in our 2016 taxes. There are other state rebates, as well.
     We wanted (pretty extensive) solar panels because we had had them in our previous residence before we moved here to Cape Cod, and noted vast energy savings then. We got a total of 40 panels, 12.6 kWatts, installed on our present house here in Marstons Mills. They put most on the main house, and some on the garage.

  After extensive research on solar companies and systems I can confidently say that Green Power Energy is the best choice for a system purchase. The quality of products offered surpasses the large companies ( Sunrun and Solar City ) we looked at and at a much lower price. 
  The whole experience has been excellent. From Tim helping us design a system to meet our needs,the contract was straight forward,all the permits handled for us,the installation crew were professional and skilled at their work, and Dave the master electrician who completed the final inspection and net meter install. They are also the only company to consider and install squirrel guards to protect the investment of a solar system.

1620,1625,20383,"I had absolutely no clue when it came to solar. Initially, we received an energy audit through National Grid (which basically gave me a couple free light bulbs and a power strip). They told us  that we would be a great candidate for a solar array and gave us a pamphlet for a national solar company. We called to inquire about solar and within two days they had a person at our house and hustling us on how great and how cheap an array would be and by the end of a 3 hour visit they had us sign an initial, nonbinding contract to have an array that offered no information of size, type, or brand. Perplexed that I still had no knowledge of what I just did, I started looking online and came across Mass Solar Loan website that went over some of the benefits of ownership (National Company pretty much only rents/lease out the solar panels rather than offering up front ownership). That's where I came across Great Sky Solar. My first conversation with Michael Monroe from Great Sky Solar, helped me tremendously with the decision that I made, and luckily I was able to cancel the leasing contract with the national company.  I didn't want to make the same mistake again, so I had Great Sky and another local company come design arrays for our house. At no point did I feel rushed or even persuaded to sign anything from Great Sky or the other company. Where Great Sky rose above and beyond compared to the other local company was Michael and Katherine's willingness to help guide us through the Mass Solar Loan Program as well as setting up our array's solar energy renewable credit (SREC). They even told us about loan support through the state that could possibly lower the cost of the system. The other local company did not offer any information on either one of these programs nor would help us through the process when we asked. At each step of the way Katherine or Michael were there to help answer any questions we had. Now that we have had our system up and running for over 6 months we have received our first SREC payment and have not had an electricity bill since. The customer support and friendly relationship this company offers has been the best I have ever experienced, especially when making such a big investment. They made the whole process smooth and stress free. If you are thinking about solar, I would highly recommend you call Great Sky Solar.

It was apparent from the start that Jim had his act together!!  I had contacted 4 other vendors and some I felt were competent.  But none had as good a grasp on the product or the best way to utilize our assets.  Being farmers, we had the good fortune to be able to pay multiple electric bills off of one solar system.  Jim made me aware of that and had the contacts within the electric company to make it work.  No other company that I contacted seemed to know of that possibility.  The mechanics that were on the job were great to have around.  it was extremely unpleasant outside when they were hanging panels.  We kept coffee to them and a place to get in out of the wind.

Our site was difficult--in the hills, one mile up a dirt road, over ledge and then along a ragged “path” to the south facing slope site. The slope was densely wooded with second growth trees that required two cuts.

The installation team was excellent and it was a tough job.  The cement as well as all the installation equipment had to be hauled over the rough terrain.

We’d like to give a special thank you to the electricians, Troy and his team, who in addition to their excellent work called out an unrelated safety issue at our camp that has since been fixed.

Months later, Eric has helped us through problems (not of GSS’s making) with our meter as well as selling our SRECS.

All the GSS people we worked with were not only very professional but congenial as well.  We suspect that the job cost more than GSS’s estimate but they kept to their quote.

We highly recommend GSS.

Our choice was a local company with unequaled experience installing the systems on D.C.’s flat roofs. One of the key reasons we chose Solar Solution was their method of using a weighted system to hold the array in place, rather than puncturing the roof with nails - a method most other companies were too eager to employ, despite its unsuitability on roofs where punctures are likely to cause leaks over time.

From beginning to end, they were very professional and informative. They answered all of our questions and took the time to really explain the benefits of what they have to offer. What we really love about them is that they really understand what they are selling and they believe in it. Now, we have enjoying our low electric bills and have been able to save up for more important things. We highly recommend everyone to look into their company.

From the initial consultation with Eric to the financing with GreenSky and the expert installation crew - everyone was a pleasure to deal with.  We looked at several other solar installers from NH, MA, and even RI, but none seemed as professional, friendly, or knowledgable and forthcoming about what we could actually expect during the whole process and beyond.  We heard nightmare stories about other companies, trouble getting straightforward answers to questions, delays and trouble with scheduling, rude installers and faulty work, but our experience with GSS has been nothing less that fantastic!

You cannot get out from under a loan of this nature, due to the fact that no matter how much you pay, you will be paying the interest fist!  REMEMBER, IT'S COMPOUNDED DAILY!

1664,1669,21348,"We had gone through a bidding process with six different solar installers that offered to install solar panels on our roof. After two months of closely evaluating and comparing the different companies we picked Solar Wolf Energy, Inc., and, at the end, it's hard to imagine that our satisfaction could be any higher. SWE is an installer I would not hesitate to recommend to all my friends and to my family as well. 
 
Overall: 5 stars on all accounts
 
Here's how it breaks down:
 
Communication
There was no other company more responsive and helpful throughout the entire process. The sales rep answered every question we had no matter how technical it was. He was able and willing to work with our needs and ideas and did not push us toward anything we would not want or would not make sense for our house.
 
Cost
Even though cost made only part of our decision, Solar Wolf Energy bid the lowest cost and fully met our expectation. Comparing with other bidders, SWE offered a price 15% lower than the highest bidder, while using the same equipment and material.
 
Time
Once we signed a contract, the installation was slowed down only by the permitting process, which took about five or six weeks. Then, with the permit in our binder, the rest was speedy - only two weeks or about. After the installation was completed and got inspected, the electric company got us connected and we become a tiny electric power house. We were up running the first day of March, only eight weeks after signing the contract.
 
Installation
Crew of three young, skilled installers finished both installing the panels and all electric wiring in two days with some time to spare. The wiring was laid very cleanly. It's running through the attic and then outside along a water spout and done very neatly. Installing the panels on the roof was the laborious part of the process - with twenty-four panels total there was quite a few screws to drill. The boys missed rafters in a handful of spots, but after inspection they did not hesitate one bit to re-drill all the ones they had missed.
There is only one criticism I can make: I was not home for the actual laying down the panels, and when I got home I could not but notice that the panels they were not installed slightly off center on the roof. There are closer to the left side by some five inches. Not a big deal, perhaps, but it is the one wrinkle on the whole process. Maybe there was some technical reason for it, but I have no doubts that installers would work with me and install the panels symmetrically if I only knew I should have considered mentioning it and asked for it up front. Well, on my next house I'll make sure to put it on my check list.
 
Epilogue
So, quite happy throughout the whole process we’ve been. Naturally, a company is not only as good as the job that it does, but it also can be measured by the standard of their continuing support in a case something goes wrong. Coincidentally, we were ""fortunate"" to test this metric as well. After a few days watching with excitement the on-line production reports at SolarEdge, we noticed that the reporting had started to be flaky. Instead of updating four times a day, it would only update once or even skip a day. I contacted Solar Wolf and they told me they had noticed that too already. Apparently, the cellular unit in the inverter was defective. Solar Wolf promptly contacted SolarEdge who sent a new unit overnight. An installer from Solar Wolf Energy came the day after and replaced the unit. Since then the reporting works satisfactory.
 
Conclusions
It goes without saying that I do recommend Solar Wolf Energy to anyone who is interested in dressing their roof up in solar panels. The company makes the whole process painless - they are fast, flexible, and knowledgeable. They have their own crew of installers who do a very good job. It's apparent they do care. As a bonus, SWE is also cheaper than most other companies. And last but not the least, they take care of problems should any come even after the project's been completed.",5,0.743
1665,1670,21910,"Matt and his team from LivSolar recently completed a solar installation on the roof of our home. Overall, the whole experience was excellent, starting from system design, through permitting, to the final timely installation.  I got bids from 4 solar installation companies and several things stood out with LivSolar above and beyond their competition.   Matt was extremely thorough during his site evaluation (including roof measurements during his first visit, in fairly miserable weather), multiple communications with the Fire Department and the City to make sure that the system as designed could be installed on the roof, and last but not least, explanations of benefits resulting from adding the Power Conditioning Box (PCB) that comes with LivSolar's system. Matt run a nice demonstration showing how PCB may lower the energy usage by heavy power ""consumers"", such as AC, washer/dryer, etc.. LivSolar's system comes also with the WiFi monitoring device that transmits power production data for every panel level every 15 minutes. The system has been operational for about two weeks now and on a good sunny day it delivers very impressive performance exceeding by a wide margin our initial expectations for power production. Overall, I would highly recommend LivSolar to anyone interested in solar installation. ",5,0.8516

1670,1675,6200,"I highly recommend RGS Energy as your home solar installer.  I am 100% satisfied with my system and the people who helped me through the process.


When I was first interested in solar I didn't know where to start.  The first company who came to my home was SolarCity.  The sales person who came to my home wasn't knowledgable and couldn't answer my questions about loans, SRECs for Massachusetts, or technical details of the system.  It felt very much like he was a used car salesman.  I was also disappointed in SolarCity's proposal.  It didn't have much technical detail about the system.  I left that experience wanting more expertise.


Then I applied for multiple solar quotes from https://www.energysage.com/.  RGS was one of the quotes I received.  Their rep who contacted me was excellent.  He was very knowledgable and patient.  He answered all my questions about technical details of the system, SRECs, and solar loans.  He even recommended a bank that participates in the Mass Solar Loan program and gives great rates and has great service.  I ended up choosing RGS Energy because of this great service.


All the other people I worked with from RGS Energy in the installation process were also wonderful.  Their pre-sales reps were highly knowledgable and very responsive to all my questions.  The person who inspected my home for the final design proposal was professional and friendly.  The construction manager who coordinated the installation was excellent and kept me up to date on everything happening.  She coordinated everything from installation to electrical inspections, to building inspections.  The RGS Energy installers were excellent.  They were very friendly and did excellent, neat work.  The installation has turned out wonderful and I'm 100% satisfied with it.  I credit the excellent people involved with this result.


Installing a solar system on your home is a long and complex process.  Choose a company like RGS Energy that gives you knowledgable experts at each step of the process.  There are lots of things to consider like size of the system, buy or lease, and solar loans.  There are also many steps in the process such as pre-installation measurements, design proposals and acceptance, loan approvals, installation work, and electrical and building inspections.  RGS Energy was knowledgable and with me every step of the way.  Their expert coordinators handled everything and made it all go smoothly.  All the installers and electricians they sent to my home actually worked for RGS Energy and were skilled and friendly.  They were not sloppy sub-contractors.  RGS took the time to neatly route the wiring into my attic and basement out of sight.


If you go solar, go with RGS for great service and a great installation.

I will take them up on that and write another review if they don't come through with their offer at true up.  But these guys have been solid all the way through and I'm sure I won't have to.

I'm as delighted as I could be and refer my friends to GSP every chance I get.

1706,1712,21113,"We found Eastern CT Solar based on searching for a local installer with good reviews and references, and we were not disappointed!  They were professional and not pushy, and guided us through the entire process.  I was most impressed that they pulled all the permits with the town, commissioned a local professional engineer to do a strength analysis of our roof, and installed structural bracing in our attic to keep everything sturdy.  The system was installed quickly and works great...based on the preliminary performance numbers I think it will outperform the estimates based on the initial solar survey.  This isn't suprising because I talked to previous customers who had a similar experience.  I will update this review once I get a few weeks of usage data!

They had to do the job in two stages, installing the structural foundation in the fall, as well as digging the trench for the cable to the house, and then finishing the job in the spring. This was made even more difficult because of the death of one of the owners in the middle of the project. Nevertheless, they did everything they said they would do right on time and excellently. When they flip the switch, the sun started providing me with power seamlessly.

I took the time to get 7 estimates, studied them in detail, researched carefully the solar providers who provided them, and talked to consultants at Energy Sage to understand the differences among the various proposals.  On all the criteria, Invaleon Solar ranked at the top.  

We have a small roof, with less than ideal pitch, and east/west exposures.  In the past, we were told we weren't good candidates for solar, but Invaleon recommended very efficient LE premium panels and promised we would be able to meet 100% of our energy needs.  On top of that, their per watt cost was the lowest of the 7 estimates, despite being one of only two companies that recommended premium panels for our installation.  

What also sold us was their commitment to our local community.  Their website features an installation they donated to the Good Shepard Community Care hospice at a time when the company was relatively new, and the story of their founders, Tom Wu and Carrie Sunde, makes Invasion a company you can feel good to do business with.  They answered every question we had promptly and patiently (and we had a lot!), installation took only two uneventful days, and they helped us line up financing through a special program in our state.   

We also found that the company was carefully conservative in their estimate of the power we would be able to generate, something other companies exaggerated in their proposals.  Much as we appreciated their approach, we are nonetheless very pleased to find that in the seven months since installation, our system has generated more power than estimated, meaning a greater savings for us.

The crews who arrived to survey our roof, and to install the system were exceptional.  They have all been very professional and efficient.  Net result, we are now generating lots and lots of electrons on our roof, days after agreeing to purchase their system, with ZERO hassle.

I began working with Sven from Invaleon who was incredibly helpful in helping size my install and compare the various components.  I had a specific vision and he was very patient and extremely thorough when following up on different product options (I wanted the latest technology).  The install went smoothly, and although I have seen a few of the rubber end caps come loose this is a very minor issue and I have not bothered to ask for a service call.  Probably the most satisfying aspect of working with Invaleon is that Sven made himself available after the install to help with monitoring and API access questions- I could not have asked for more.

I ended up contracting Solar Specialists to install  a 10kW system on my house and couldn't be happier. I had a few unique requests (battery backup capability, network monitoring, etc) and Chris was able to make them happen. He also offered help with filing and filling out the TECO paperwork needed to activate net metering.

I've had the system installed for about half a year and have made money back from the  electric company each month. We financed our system through a home equity loan it looks like our  R.O.I. is roughly 7 years.

I found Chris to be down-to-earth and easy to work with. I'm an engineer by trade and played dumb when requesting quotes from other contractors.

1793,1799,21143,"I can’t say enough great things about Invaleon Solar Technologies. They were great from start to finish.

The sales rep, Sven, was very patient walking me through the process and answering all my questions. He was also low key and informative, and not aggressive like some other companies’ sales reps. The only disappointment was after I asked a few times whether the feed from the panels could travel down inside the house from the roof to the basement. His consistent reply was along the lines of, “That shouldn’t be a problem.” During the walkthrough prior to the installation, the project manager said that could not be done. Not only that, but he said in the several dozen installations he had done, he had only seen one house that could have that done in. My feeling is Sven either knew better or should have known better. But, that was just one little blip in an overall great experience. Months later, I sent Sven a couple email questions that he promptly and thoroughly answered.

The reason I asked about snaking the the feed down the center of the house was because I had seen some ugly installations with pipe running across the roof and down the side of the house. It was very visible from the street. The project manager, Chris, did such a great design of the installation, you cannot see the pipes from the front whatsoever, and have to look around the house very carefully to even find them at all. Chris was great during the pre-installation walkthrough, the installation and during all the follow-up actions such as inspections and new meter installation by the electric company. He was both very supportive and very honest, and I greatly appreciated that.

My biggest frustrations were with the CEO, Tom, who put 52 panels down on the state application, instead of the 24 I was actually getting, and accidentally sent me an email confirming the cancellation of my installation that was meant for someone else. I just hope that he knows what a great crew he has working for him and acknowledges them for that.

No company is 100% great or 100% horrible. Anyone that submits a review suggesting that is not being honest. Any issues I had with Invaleon were very minor, I wholeheartedly recommend Invaleon without hesitation, and I would without question definitely do business with them again.",5,0.8651

I got quotes from the “top five” solar companies as well as the local big box hardware stores and then I came across the web site Energy Sage.  They were a fountain of information and brought me several new quotes, including GreenPower Energy’s.  (What I like about Energy Sage was that they send you quotes without you having to give out your personal information-unless you want to.)  Bottom line, I found that GreenPower Energy offered the best value; they had great equipment, great pricing and great customer service.  Tim DeSevo, their sales manager, was knowledgeable, responsive and easy to work with.  The installation crew was professional, courteous, and flexible to my needs.  (I actually asked them to delay installation while I had a new roof installed).   Installation went smoothly - they took care of everything - and I am now generating my SRECS.

1795,1801,566,"I am not a ""newbie"" to solar.  I started out working with 12-volt panels in the early 90's just to power my lawn mower.  I ended up with a battery bank, and the various inverters I needed to operate every electrical appliance in my house.  I even ran the clothes washer off my batteries.  Then, I went grid-tie, encouraged by tax incentives, and the payback for putting energy back into the system.  Recently, I decided to add more panels due to changing conditions at my home.  I gave this site a try, and this was one of only two places to repond to my inquiry.

I asked for ""American-Made"" components.  The agent of the company told me none were available since the only one she new of had declared bankruptcy.  I contacted that company, and here is there reply:

Thank you for reaching out to customer support.  SolarWorld USA has not filed any form of bankruptcy, we are moving forward with business as usual.  Distributors have plenty stock available and your installer still can get US made panels for your project.

Additionally, I found another company in Texas manufacturing American-Made panels, but this company's agent had ""never heard of them.""  It just seems to me that an intelligent, well-run company would know about, and be aware of all options, and would employ people who stayed on top of their game.  

I have lost confidence in this company, and feel they are just trying to ""squeeze"" people new to solar instead of conscientiously offering a quality service.

1804,1810,20665,"I attended a solar energy presentation from a Seattle company at the Indian reservation. . I learned enough to consider installation but It sounded like a time share presentation. I was encouraged to buy now. A one hour assessment of my house was made and a price of installation was given.

I called Whidbey Sun and Wind for a second opinion because it is a local company. The agent was very thorough in assessing our home for solar energy. It is a two story house  with an unobstructed view South and a roof with concrete shakes. In a few days I received a very impressive written proposal with several options. We chose the 8.4 kw option because it had the possibility of being paid off by savings in 6 years. The system is larger and less expensive than the system proposed by the first company.

Installation began in February and was completed in 5 days despite somewhat rainy weather and the problem of working on a second story roof with slick fragile tiles. There were also cathedral ceilings below the roof that added to the complexity of the installation. The installers were excellent. Neighbors on both sides have expressed  desires to install solar in the future. 

Adam Wundrow supervised the project from proposal to completion and spent many hours solving a computer glitch that was interfering with the monitoring system.

I just received my first Puget Sound Energy bill since the installation. The three year average May bill (since we had installed a hybrid water heater) is  $243.16. This bill is $93.83 with a 5 day longer billing cycle and 3 degrees colder average temperature than the previous year. I look forward to watching the electrical and tax savings and incentives lead to payment of the original cost of the system.

Given the environmental cost advantages, there is no reason that someone in our circumstances and with our housing site should not go with solar photovoltaic.   

For the uninformed, here are the environmental advantages that I see:  

1.  Twenty percent of the solar energy impinging on our collectors is now converted to electricity rather than heat.  Otherwise this heat would contribute to global warming.  

2.  The collectors shield a substantial portion of our roof from solar rays which should reduce the air conditioning load for our second story.  

3.  Fuel burned in power plants to supply our electricity is now eliminated along with the greenhouse gases created thereby.

There certainly is no shortage of installers who want your business. I received the sales pitch from two big name installers and after much internal debate, I chose the micro-inverters from Sunnyside Solar.
That was the only time in the entire process that I wasn't 100% sure of my decision.
After I agreed to do it EVERYTHING went beautifully. From customer service keeping me informed to the awesome installers, everyone and every interaction was polite and professional.
I am quite fussy about how my home looks and I did not want my system visible from the street. They made it invisible! I have seen many installs and none look as good as mine. I am so happy!

1821,1827,21914,"I started looking at rooftop solar panel installations in January (for reference, it is currently May). They’ve been dropping in price so much lately that I figured it was time to see just how much money they could actually save (don’t worry, I’ll answer this for you at the end). I contacted a few of the highly-rated companies out there for quotes and consultations, GSS being one of them. After speaking with them all and comparing their offers, their online reviews and the behavior of the associates they sent out to my house, I decided to go with GSS. The rest of the review is my story working with them but if you want the summary: these guys are an incredibly professional team that really know their stuff and work with you every step of the way. I have zero regrets about choosing them and I would absolutely recommend them to everybody looking to go solar.

Here are the details about my experience with them.

I called GSS up and explained my situation: “I’m interested in rooftop solar, I have some electric cars that eat a ton of power and I want to charge them with renewable energy so I need a pretty big array.” Eric Kilens was the rep that responded to my call. He came out and took some standard measurements; roof size, angle, azimuth, tree cover… the usual stuff. That took all of twenty minutes. He then proceeded to stick around and talk to me for an extra half hour about the whole process, the technology behind solar, the net metering policies in New Hampshire, electric vehicles, and just about every other relevant topic that came up. I’m the kind of guy that wants to know everything that’s going on and he was more than happy to answer. This extended past the initial consult because after each company got in touch with me I proceeded to flood their inboxes with more questions. Eric was the only one that didn’t eventually get fed up with me. He responded quickly to each one – usually that same day or the day after. If he didn’t know the answer, then he knew who to ask. He got me in touch with other experts at GSS who traditionally work behind-the-scenes like Alec the warehouse manager or Erik (with a K), one of the owners, when I had detailed questions about panel specs or inverter choices. 

Eric and I went back and forth quite a bit about array design, number of panels, brand, power rating, and even the microinverter size to go with them. It wasn’t just a “here’s what we’re going to do, take it or leave it” kind of situation… the whole team was very flexible and accommodating, even if I made unusual requests that went against their typical installations. To give you some perspective, we started the paperwork in February and we were still making changes to the plan in mid-April as new technology became available and replaced the old stuff. Eric, Tanya and Emily were always very courteous and cheerful when taking my questions and requests. This was especially appreciated during the permitting and paperwork review processes. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, but you have to get a lot of people to sign off on a solar installation before you can actually install it. These guys held my hand through the whole process though. They kept me up-to-date every day on who would be showing up to inspect which parts of my house and what that meant for the project. They took care of all the coordination between the town inspector, the utility company, and the PUC for the state tax credit. I know it was a lot of work, but I never had to deal with it. They did it all.

After three months of preparation, the permits were finally in place and the parts we decided on had arrived. Now, my setup involved 14.4 kW of power from 48 panels in six rows across two roofs. GSS brought a team of five to my house and they managed to put the whole array together in a day and a half. These guys were just as polite and respectful as the staff I’d been coordinating with so far. The installation crew has been in the game for a while and they are masters of their respective trades – that much I gathered right away – but what really surprised me is how well they worked together as a team. They kept communication constant, they didn’t argue about anything, and they had a rhythm to their work so they all finished the important parts at the same time. I shadowed them throughout the whole process, asking questions about what they were doing and why they decided to go with one technique over another. Each one seemed happy that I was taking an interest in their work instead of just leaving them alone. I learned about electrical engineering from Phil and Troy, mounting rail construction from Nate and Brandon, the microinverter map from Darren, and panel laying from Jake and Zach on the second day. Not only that, but they told me the company’s story and a bit about their team dynamics as well. GSS is a fairly small team compared to most companies, so they have a very important advantage: they all know each other personally as friends instead of just colleagues. That was pretty apparently when I saw how they worked together, but hearing them say it was a key value of the company really made it clear. These guys are a tight-knit team, and they all believe in the mission. This is definitely the crew you want doing your solar installation.

Eric told me early on that GSS aims to “under-promise and over-deliver”. Well, my array has been active for about two weeks now and I can confidently say that they pulled that off. The panels take care of all of my power needs and they ended up costing about $100 per month less than my old power bill. These guys started saving me money the moment the array got switched on. My roof is beautiful and slick, it’s generating more than enough to power our home and our cars, and I learned a ridiculous amount of stuff about the world of solar throughout the journey. GSS made it the experience an absolute pleasure. I strongly recommend them to anyone that wants to look at getting a solar installation.",5,0.84

1823,1829,21914,"When we decided to go solar, we used Energy Sage to find qualified installers near us. We received 7 online quotes and chose 4 installers to come and give us an estimate. Everybody was nice and knowledgeable and we would have selected one of them, but I remembered seeing GSS trucks around so I gave them a call (they were not on Energy Sage at the moment). GSS's representative (Andy) was the only one who got on the roof and measured it. That impressed us (it was January). Their prices were very competitive too, so we chose them. We wanted a local company, with experience, but the right sized so that our small project wouldn't get lost in the shuffle. They even performed some other electrical work for us.

The installers were great, nice people, very efficient, all around a good experience. All the people in the office is also happy to help and very responsive. Only downside was the 3.5 months in between signing the contract and having the system in operation. Part of it it's due to the utility and the town, though.

We are very happy to have our solar system and would highly recommend GSS.",5,0.9168

Omar is the owner and out of all the companies I talk to he answered most questions and  I never felt like he was just trying to sell to me.   I always end up having a lot of questions and every time I emailed or texted him he'd shoot me an answer right back.  

His team was professional and fast and even came out on a holiday to finish up the installation.  

They even cleaned up some construction debris left by another contractor from a previous job without me asking.  

 I'm so happy with the service that the last thing Im going to mention is how great the price was.  Of all the quotes I received they were the highest output at the lowest cost with the best warranty of any quote I received.

Well he didn't do anything but sit down and talk about solar power.  We told him we wanted solar power but could not get approved for a loan.  He said no problem they work with many different banks and he did not see a reason we could not get approved. So we did the paperwork and was told that their engineers would be out the next day to look over the site.  The representative guaranteed that I would receive a call from ""The Owner"" if we didn't get approved,  well I am still waiting for the call but don't expect one.  I called the representative, Dave,  that afternoon and he acted very surprised that we had not received the call and he was going to make a call to the owner right away.  That was the last time I had contact with this company.  How hard is it to pick up the phone and tell the customer that they were not approved.  Dave spent over  ""3 hours"" at our home.

They are highly experienced dealing with Duke Energy and the town inspectors and were always present for an inspection by either Duke or the town.  Now that my panels are paid off and I have only 40% of the electric bill that I would had paid if I had not put the solar system up on the roof.   Now I save about $600 per year and will continue to do so for the next 15 - 20 years.  Now that is a great deal .  Thank you state of NC and Federal Government.  I am just waiting for battery prices (Sundance does batteries as well) for the Telsa Powerwall 2 to fall , then I will  install batteries to recover all the solar energy produced and load shift my energy consumption to off peak hours. Under these conditions I would  pay only $ 0.06 per KWH.

From the initial conversations with rep Joe Kemmler, to the installation crew, right through to activation and subsequent savings, this has been nothing but a smooth process. The process was very transparent and everyone was very clear when communicating expected versus potential timelines even those that were out of their hands. At the end of the day our system was activated earlier than expected and now 6 months later we are still using the credit from our last actual payment to the electric company of $220 back in Oct. We have over $60 left and last months bill would have been less than $5 if we didn't have the credit...we are only in May...WOOHOO!!!

All of the quotes I received were similar in terms of cost-per-kW, but I didn't make my decision solely on this factor. I chose Invaleon for multiple reasons.  First, they didn't waste my time.  They were the only installers that brought all the people and equipment needed to talk me through the process AND inspect my roof and attic in one visit, rather than needing to return.  Second, Sven, the sales rep, and Tom, the owner, are solar energy nerds.  They seemed happy to geek out and, at my request,  talk at length through the nitty gritty details of solar energy and my project in particular. Sven was very capable at answering even my most technical questions. Third, they proposed using premium panels. All in all, I got the impression that this company had found a way to build a slightly better mousetrap.

SolarMax...Why nobody, despite many concerning emails and phone calls has not contacted me? You guaranteed my system, why are you not honoring it? It is 3 month now and no fix for a very hazardous situation. 

Marvin, the sales person, deserves a 5 star review! Yes... he could sell me a bad system! You know your job!

1910,1916,22353,"Dan, and his team, walked me through every step of the process. He gave me all of my options and let me choose what was best for my budget. There was absolutely NO pressure. 

Before you go with a Solar City or Code Green, remember these are big companies with several middle men, that all have to get paid. Dan's pricing beat all the others, which is impressive because he only installs top-of-the-line equipment.  Right now I can pull up the Solar Edge App, on my phone, and tell you exactly how much power each, individual, solar panel is producing, in real time. I know exactly how much power I make every day, week, month, and year. Also, I really did spend a lot of time pricing him against Solar City and they were offering me less than half ($11,000 verses $23,000) for the 15 years of SRECs that my system will produce. That's a huge difference and made it possible to own my system as opposed to leasing it, which means I also got to keep the tax benefits.

I would say that the best reason to go with Dan is the ability to have control over every aspect of the project. Every little part of the system was placed exactly how and where I wanted it. He always took the time to answer my questions. Going Solar is complicated because of all of the state and township hurdles and you need someone, that knows as much as he does, to help you navigate them.

The end result is aesthetically pleasing. My wife was very hesitant about putting panels on the roof, but, even she, loves the result.

I am a few months in and just got my second electric bill, or lack there of. My system has not only produced all of my electric for the past 2 months, it has produced an excess of 471 KWh.

Invaleon people visited my house to assess my solar potential in person - some companies rely solely on satellite photos. Their estimate was delivered quickly, and when I asked for a system size adjustment, they made it quickly. The work was scheduled promptly and completed quickly. The installation, both outside and inside, is neat and clean. They've been very helpful in navigating the regulatory complexity (power company, solar credits company, town permits, etc.).

Their internal communication fell slightly short when the worker who did the final indoor configuration didn't come with the mandatory indoor and outdoor labels for the equipment, so a second trip was needed. The company also needs a bit of work on professional appearance - while everyone is clean, friendly, and competent, their attire is often very casual and they don't wear company logo clothing or carry company ID cards.

1922,1929,22460,"Overall very good experience with Invaleon both in terms of the system supplied and help and advice along the way.

Major points to note are:

1.Sales - Head of Sales (Sven) knows the city and utility company regulations and also the technical aspects of the systems. His advice can be relied on. More than can be said for many sales people in the solar power industry.

2. System Design - you can let Invaleon take all the decisions for you or work with the owner (Tom) to build a customised system. Tom is a technical whizz on solar and happy to sit down and discuss and explain the various options. Ours was a large customised system that none of the other suppliers seemed interested in discussing let alone supplying.

3. System Components - use SolarEdge -  DC optimisers and inverters -  and high quality LG panels. Company philosophy seems to be 'build to last'. Price was still competitive despite using top end components.

4. Timeliness - from signing the contract to switching on the system (with all permissions) - took about 4 weeks. There were no delays and Tom & Sven kept us informed on progress daily.

5. Roof Strengthening - if the roof structure is weak (ours clearly was and had worried me for some time) Invaleon can do the reinforcing themselves. No need to go elsewhere and no need to hire separate contractors.

6. Installation Crew - (headed by Frank) Direct employees not contractors so they have a stake in keeping you happy. Pleasant to deal with and responsive. All aspects of installation start with Frank saying, ""This is what we propose to do. Is that OK?"" If you have different ideas Frank accommodates them if technically possible. This is important. An aesthetically pleasing installation is rarely the easiest option for the installer but is key to maintaining property value. Key aspects are external conduit placement, inverter location and solar panel alignment and type. The team did an excellent job on all the above.

7. After Sales Service - Early days yet but all indications are that they don't just take your money after completion and then disappear. The monitoring system kept dropping out (fault of the phone company, Verizon,whose internet services are not the best and not a fault of the Invaleon install or Solar Edge hardware. Made no difference to power output so just annoying rather than anything else). Tom had noted the patchy connection when looking at the system output remotely and sent their IT expert Chris to swap the connection over to our Comcast network. Now running fine. Another After Sales consideration is that as technology evolves it's useful to be able to call on the original supplier for upgrades - eg battery backup for power outages. Tom has an interest in the industry and is up to date on the technology and willing to discuss future options.

Invaleon were initially selected because they were responsive, seemed technically well informed and were offering high-end components at a competitive price. Having said that, we were still nervous signing up because a solar electricity system is such a major purchase. As it turned out everything went well, the various people were a pleasure to deal with and we're now on track to a near-zero electricity bill. Full payback expected in 4 to 5 years.

I took the time to get 7 estimates, studied them in detail, researched carefully the solar providers who provided them, and talked to consultants at Energy Sage to understand the differences among the various proposals.  On all the criteria, Invaleon Solar ranked at the top.  

We have a small roof, with less than ideal pitch, and east/west exposures.  In the past, we were told we weren't good candidates for solar, but Invaleon recommended very efficient LE premium panels and promised we would be able to meet 100% of our energy needs.  On top of that, their per watt cost was the lowest of the 7 estimates, despite being one of only two companies that recommended premium panels for our installation.  

What also sold us was their commitment to our local community.  Their website features an installation they donated to the Good Shepard Community Care hospice at a time when the company was relatively new, and the story of their founders, Tom Wu and Carrie Sunde, makes Invasion a company you can feel good to do business with.  They answered every question we had promptly and patiently (and we had a lot!), installation took only two uneventful days, and they helped us line up financing through a special program in our state.   

We also found that the company was carefully conservative in their estimate of the power we would be able to generate, something other companies exaggerated in their proposals.  Much as we appreciated their approach, we are nonetheless very pleased to find that in the seven months since installation, our system has generated more power than estimated, meaning a greater savings for us.  As a result, I think the payback on our system will occur in even less time than they estimated. 

For value, quality, service and responsiveness, you really can't do better than Invaleon Solar. ",5,0.8894
1926,1933,22460,"I choose Invaleon over six other bidders, because they were very knowledgeable and honestly answered all my questions. The installation was performed on schedule and went smooth. The staff is friendly and system works great! I would definitely recommend them!  ",5,0.8221

Their combination of excellent responsiveness, willingness to investigate different panels at different prices to make for the best possible outcome and internal work force that they could closely monitor made for an excellent experience.  Since I'm going to live with our system, they have continued to be very responsive and engaged. They very much give the impression that they are in it for the long-haul -- unlike many others.

I began working with Sven from Invaleon who was incredibly helpful in helping size my install and compare the various components.  I had a specific vision and he was very patient and extremely thorough when following up on different product options (I wanted the latest technology).  The install went smoothly, and although I have seen a few of the rubber end caps come loose this is a very minor issue and I have not bothered to ask for a service call.  Probably the most satisfying aspect of working with Invaleon is that Sven made himself available after the install to help with monitoring and API access questions- I could not have asked for more.  In summary, I'm extremely happy with the system's performance and Invaleon's service has been excellent.  I find myself watching the production almost everyday!",5,0.8268

We are now waiting for the next step in the process,  and looking forward to have our system up and-running very soon. I gave Invaleon four stars across the board because our project is not yet complete. I will update this when we finish our project and I'm hoping to give this company five stars and rave reviews which I think they will deserve judging from what we have experienced up until this point.

1933,1940,22460,"I can’t say enough great things about Invaleon Solar Technologies. They were great from start to finish.

The sales rep, Sven, was very patient walking me through the process and answering all my questions. He was also low key and informative, and not aggressive like some other companies’ sales reps. The only disappointment was after I asked a few times whether the feed from the panels could travel down inside the house from the roof to the basement. His consistent reply was along the lines of, “That shouldn’t be a problem.” During the walkthrough prior to the installation, the project manager said that could not be done. Not only that, but he said in the several dozen installations he had done, he had only seen one house that could have that done in. My feeling is Sven either knew better or should have known better. But, that was just one little blip in an overall great experience. Months later, I sent Sven a couple email questions that he promptly and thoroughly answered.

The reason I asked about snaking the the feed down the center of the house was because I had seen some ugly installations with pipe running across the roof and down the side of the house. It was very visible from the street. The project manager, Chris, did such a great design of the installation, you cannot see the pipes from the front whatsoever, and have to look around the house very carefully to even find them at all. Chris was great during the pre-installation walkthrough, the installation and during all the follow-up actions such as inspections and new meter installation by the electric company. He was both very supportive and very honest, and I greatly appreciated that.

My biggest frustrations were with the CEO, Tom, who put 52 panels down on the state application, instead of the 24 I was actually getting, and accidentally sent me an email confirming the cancellation of my installation that was meant for someone else. I just hope that he knows what a great crew he has working for him and acknowledges them for that.

No company is 100% great or 100% horrible. Anyone that submits a review suggesting that is not being honest. Any issues I had with Invaleon were very minor, I wholeheartedly recommend Invaleon without hesitation, and I would without question definitely do business with them again.",5,0.8651
1934,1941,22460,"The price was competitive, technical assessment seemed competent, the economic projections and presentation were professional, installation was prompt and efficient, and, so far, the performance of the system has matched predictions and expectations.  Given the environmental cost advantages, there is no reason that someone in our circumstances and with our housing site should not go with solar photovoltaic.   

For the uninformed, here are the environmental advantages that I see:  

1.  Twenty percent of the solar energy impinging on our collectors is now converted to electricity rather than heat.  Otherwise this heat would contribute to global warming.  

2.  The collectors shield a substantial portion of our roof from solar rays which should reduce the air conditioning load for our second story.  

3.  Fuel burned in power plants to supply our electricity is now eliminated along with the greenhouse gases created thereby.  

4.  There is a fourth factor, I believe, that escapes me now.  ",5,0.7003
1935,1942,22460,"Working with Invaleon was a pleasure from start to finish.

- The sales process, led by Sven, was just the right balance of being attentive without being at all pushy.
- The site visit to quote the system was by far the most thorough and professional of all the installers I considered, giving me high confidence that installation would go according to plan.
- Installation was straightforward and performed to a high standard. A lot of thought went into positioning the inverter and conduit to minimize the visual impact and I'm totally happy with the result.
- Communication was great throughout the entire process and the system was up and running within three weeks of signing the contract.
- Invaleon matched the most best price I was quoted but still provided the same high-quality equipment and a first rate installation process.

In addition to highly recommending Invaleon, I was also very happy with the EnergySage platform. Having several different installers quoting the same equipment was helpful in identifying the right solution for my house and the platform made it simple to compare prices, taking reviews into account.",5,0.6908
1936,1943,22460,"After receiving multiple quotes through EnergySage, I met with three different installers.  All of the quotes I received were similar in terms of cost-per-kW, but I didn't make my decision solely on this factor. I chose Invaleon for multiple reasons.  First, they didn't waste my time.  They were the only installers that brought all the people and equipment needed to talk me through the process AND inspect my roof and attic in one visit, rather than needing to return.  Second, Sven, the sales rep, and Tom, the owner, are solar energy nerds.  They seemed happy to geek out and, at my request,  talk at length through the nitty gritty details of solar energy and my project in particular. Sven was very capable at answering even my most technical questions. Third, they proposed using premium panels. All in all, I got the impression that this company had found a way to build a slightly better mousetrap.  They followed through the whole process, and my panels have been operating as expected for about six months now.  I am happy with the outcome.",5,0.6124

1943,1951,1831,"Our relationship with Solargeneration began through a referral from a trusted hydronic radiant engineer.  After several exploratory meetings with Morgan from Solargeneration, we reached an agreement for a 32 panel roof mounted 10KW photo voltaic array.  The system passes through a pair of inverters with SolarEdge monitoring and runs like a champ.  We've had the system in operation for about six months at time of this writing and have generated 5.27MW.  

Morgan, Zac, Gabe and the crew at Solargeneration made the process easy, answering our questions and inspiring a feeling of confidence in their competence.  They took care of all the permitting, which in the Town of Poughkeepsie is no small matter.  The solar system we ended up with was the biggest we could reasonably fit on our property.  Initially, the total KWs proposed were below our threshold for investment.  However, Morgan kept working options until arriving at the agreed to proposal.  

We also needed to postpone the installation for several months after signing the contract.  Again, the folks at Solargeneration accommodated our desire.  The installation sequence proceeded according to the schedule and was conducted without any surprises.  The crews were exemplary.

For us, a solar investment needed to be something we owned outright.  We were not going to let anyone put solar arrays on our primary residence unless we owned them outright, i.e. no leased solar for us.  With the generous discount from the NYSERDA, the tax rebates from NY State and the Fed, the return on investment for us should approach five years.  

What are you waiting for?  Give Solargeneration a call and make solar your reality now.

1953,1961,20712,"I had been putting off going solar for many years until I recently learned that the rules for Net Metering are changing on July 1, 2017. I knew it was time to stop procrastinating. I began researching panels, inverters, optimizers, and learned all I could about solar. After that self-study ""crash course"", I had a pretty good idea about what I wanted/needed from a solar generating system. I understood the ""nuts and bolts"" about the system itself, but I didn't have a clue as to who to have the system installed by. I started with the ""big names"" (the ones that advertise on the radio) to get an idea of what a ""typical"" solar installation consisted of and its cost. None of them had exactly what I was looking for, they had limited offerings, usually a single product or a slight variation. Their prices also seemed a bit high. My search continued. I Googled some more and read lots of Yelp reviews. Then by chance, I came across a website specific to solar--EnergySage.com. Yep, more still on everything solar, including reviews on solar contractors. Their website also made it easy to get competing bids from several solar companies at once. It's similar to using Edmunds or KBB for car shopping. I got 4 or 5 quotes almost immediately. Mostly from smaller solar companies that I've never heard of. That's how I found GR8 Energy. They had very good reviews on EnergySage and on Yelp, so I responded to them. I'm so glad I did. Unlike the ""big radio advertisers"" they offered a selection of products instead of just one or two variations of the same thing. GR8 Energy had EXACTLY what I was looking for. John Christ was the man with all the answers. Yes, he was very professional, extremely knowledgeable and helpful; but what impressed me the most was that he always responded quickly to my MANY questions via phone calls, emails and text messages. He gave me solid advice on how to fine tune the system I'd been ""researching"".  He truly understood what I was looking for. I needed a 6+kW system. I also wanted high efficiency panels like the ones by SunPower, but the high cost of these premium panels was hard to justify. John recommended the VERY efficient Panasonic HIT 330W panels with a SolarEdge power optimizer / inverter system rated at 6.6kW. These Panasonic panels are ""premium"" panels without the ""premium"" price tag. That was it! I was SOLD. Amazingly, GR8 Energy's price beat ALL of the other bids. Including those that provided ""lower end"" and (much) less efficient panels that would have required additional panels covering a lot more area, and multiple surfaces on my roof!
  

Remember what motivated me to install solar right now?--imminent Net Metering changes (NEM 2.0). With this in mind, John, Grace, Shelley, Hebert(?) and crew at GR8 Energy worked hard to get the job done ahead of schedule. Every step of the way came together just as planned. Our HOA meets only once a month and the next meeting was less than 2-weeks away from the time I signed the contract to get started. They got all the plans, drawings and everything ready to submit with time to spare. They took care of all the ""red tape"" like permitting, inspection, and filing documents with my utility company. They meticulously handled every part of the project. We were given ""Permission to Operate"" from SCE almost exactly 5-weeks from first contact with GR8 Energy. Phenomenal!
As for the installation. Hebert(?) and his talented crew really know their stuff. Our installation took the usual two days to complete. At the end of each day, you could not tell that they'd been there. No trash or debris left behind, anywhere. I'm a big DIY guy (from auto repair to woodworking and furniture building). I appreciate quality workmanship. The care they took in the installation is outstanding. Even the way they ran the electrical lines and connections is a thing of beauty! Instead of simply running conduit straight across the exterior wall, they took the time (and extra materials) to run it along the chimney and under the eaves to lessen the visual impact. Very clean. We're now generating power and I just love watching the electric meter ""run"" backwards!
  

My advice. If you are thinking about going solar, first do your homework. Understand your needs, then compare everything--especially the contractor. If you do this, I think you'll see for yourself, that you simply cannot go wrong with GR8 Energy. They are not the biggest, but as far as I'm concerned, they are absolutely the BEST! 
 

Thank you all at GR8 Energy for a job well done!

Main Points:
- They responded the fastest of any of the other companies. 
- They came out and measured within a few days and got me a quote, with options, within a week. 
- They provided coverage options that were more realistic as they actually came and measured and did an analysis as opposed to the rest of the companies that just went of the satellite pictures and wouldn't do any measurements until after you met with sales people.
- Of the 6 companies we looked at they had close to, if not the lowest, prices.
- Unlike Solar City and Vivint they had quotes ready and when we met they had designs and everything ready to go, instead of marketing material to show us. 
- So far their predictions on production are spot on. 
- They were able to handle electrical issues in my old house (unrelated to the solar install) immediately in order to pass our county inspection. 
- They handled everything for the MD state grant and permits and inspections.
- All of the installers were Courteous and professional and consulted me before making conduit runs,etc. to ensure I would be satisfied with the look and function. 
- The original designer that came out to give us quotes and designs was the point of contact through the whole thing, and was always available and checking on the progress from start to finish.

2002,2010,21542,"This is a MAJOR investment so I'll treat the review accordingly and try to cover my entire experience so far.


I met with LA Solar Group, Solar City, and Crown Solar before deciding to go with LA Solar Group. My parents have panels installed by Solar City but I decided to do some shopping around just in case there were better prices out there and it turns out Solar City was the most expensive of the 3. Crown Solar was pretty competitive but doesn't seem to have a big reputation/many reviews.


The last thing you want is to dump a bunch of money into a company and find out they went out of business and you can't get support on your hardware that was supposed to be covered by warranties.


The guys from LA Solar group are smart and competitive. They asked to see quotes from the other providers and insisted they would beat their prices.


I have a large tree in front of my house. While it does keep the house quite cool, shade is a known enemy of solar panels and they even offered to credit me for the tree removal in an effort to max out panel product.


Financing is done through LA Credit Union.


If you haven't done your homework, do study up on combo loans. It's tricky and probably sounds like a scam but relies on you getting a refund the following year.


The actual install process was pretty smooth. I didn't have to babysit the installation and the mounting is clean. I have some reverse tilt panels on the rear of my house and they seem sturdy enough. I'm not actually offended by solar panels affecting the aesthetic of buildings, so there's not much to really note other than the panels are installed exactly as they were planned in the design app.

Afterwards, it felt like I was a bit in the dark for system activation. The process doesn't end once the panels/inverter are up. You have to get permission to operate from your electric company (LADWP in my case).


It took a few emails/phone calls back and forth between LA Solar Group and DWP to get things moving. As long as you are on top of the activation process, you'll get your system running in a reasonable time. Responses to status inquiries were always received in a reasonable amount of time and my sales rep never ignored any of my text messages.


The monitoring app is somewhat limited if you are expecting live stats. Since the inverter is connected via a cellular connection, the readings only update in 4 hour intervals.",5,0.5927

After the installation I have had zero problems but Danny has still been as easily accessible to answer questions and provide follow up.

I've check my solar generation on my app from my phone just to see what the numbers are. I've been getting pretty good returns on the LG 320 panels. 

I've gotten quotes from Solar City and 2 other local installation companies and the BEST price by far was from LA Solar. I have light-weight tiles, so it cost me a little extra on top, but that was the same for ALL my other quotes. Once I've accepted their offer, the time to get permit and installation wasn't bad at all. 2-3 weeks for permit, 2 days to install, another 2 weeks for inspection of installation from city and 1 more week from SCE for PTO. 

I was in contact with Toni from LASolar most of the time, they took care of my questions and concerns throughout the whole project. I did have 1 issue with the app monitoring cost, but 1 quick phone call with Toni and it was resolved, can't beat that.

Yes, I would recommend them. So get a quote from multiple places, and if you are on the order between LASolar and another vendor, you know which one I would choose.

LA Solar also check in with us from time to time to make sure all is well - and it is! When we started this process, we'd taken numerous bids from the 'big names' when my wife found the Yelp reviews from LA Solar Group, and I gave them a call. They put in a bid, which was substantially better then the 'big names', and provided better quality panels and microinverters in their bid, when the others didn't and still cost more. All the staff there are friendly and knowledgeable, and unlike the big names, they don't hassle and pressure you into decisions. Our installation was fantastic - 1 day for a complete 18 panel installation and main service panel upgrade. 10 days later we had the permit from the inspector, and 3 weeks after that Edison gave us the go ahead. We went from contract to operational in 6 weeks, which is a timeline no-one can promise. They also patched and painted the stucco and conduit to match the house color as part of the service. We've only been online for 7-days now, but the panels are already producing more then anticipated, and we still have spring/summer to come!

While there was an interest for solar energy, we were never certain this would be a worthwhile investment. Well, a conversation at work led to an exchange of green experiences and eventually a phone call with Mike, the sales rep at Bay State Solar Solutions. Mike was sensitive to my hesitations and earned my trust to schedule a site review. During this review, my hesitations gave way to his industry knowledge and experience. I quickly discovered my home was perfectly suited for harnessing the sun's energy. After learning of my municipal energy company' solar rebate program, the available federal tax credits, really low project financing, and a program which provides quarterly dividends for every megawatt-hour of solar electricity created, my wife couldn't hold me back. I wanted a solar system and I wanted it now!

2017,2025,21542,"I have an efficient 14kw system from LA Solar with room for expansion and a EV car charger.

LA Solar was, by far, the best solar company I researched.  I was so excited to do solar but felt the prices were high, the return on investment took forever and that the companies were ""salesy"" –like car salespeople.  I deeply researched 7 solar companies and my gut didn't feel good about any of them until LA Solar Group.  Most of the other companies had to use more panels to deliver less electricity and the warranties and return on investment were not as good. 

LA Solar was the best rated by customers by far, had a strong financial rating, has been growing consistently and substantially for the last 5 years.  

Fast forward a year later, and they have been perfectly attentive and my system has been flawless.  

After LA Solar like the best choice, I walked into the office unannounced.  The CEO stopped a meeting to speak to me.  He started on the roof installing the first systems himself.  He is an ultra-smart guy, very focused on efficiency which is important for long-term survival.  He is an electrical engineer by trade and also has a roofing license.  Locally they have 8 crews installing full-time.  Nothing is subcontracted out.  This, to me, is very important.  Quality control. 
The solar designers are engineers.  The equipment is from the best manufacturers.  They don't spend money on advertising, they get their new business from referrals almost exclusively.  This, in combination with efficient and quality processes and equipment, right down the highest quality waterproof washers, is their secret sauce.  This is how they get installations done for the lowest cost, the first time, with the least amount of return service calls.  In my experience they are honest, transparent, hard working and innovative.  I met much of the sales team, the sales manager and the support staff.  Hard working, kind and educated people who care.  

My installation was done a year ago.  I went from contract to installation to approvals in less than a month.  LADWP now owes me 1600 kwh as of today.  I pay 10 dollars a month on my electric bill for connection fees, that's it and my system will be paid off in another 5 years.  It was a complete no-brainer.  Plus, they listened to my requirements.  You cannot see my system from the street, there is room for another row of panels.  I was able to have enough space to install thermal pool solar on my north face as well.  Perfect.

In a sea of questionable companies, I knew they were the best choice and it still holds true today.  Solar is not a little decision in my view.  You are letting people drill into your roof.  For me, I wanted to make sure I had the best people as partners, so I was always proud driving into my garage and that's exactly what I have with LA Solar.

I contacted most of the companies that had submitted bids, and Vladimir at LA Solar Group was most helpful both in explaining his bid as well as explaining the entire process of installing solar power. The cost of the job - spelled out explicitly in the bid - was highly competitive (I was speaking with Solar City at the same time, and they referred to LA Solar Group's bid as ""aggressive"") and complete. 

My situation was near ideal: Four or five years ago I had upgraded my electrical panel to current specs, and at the same time had a new roof installed down to the plywood.

Many companies offer 2 out of 3 of these options or say they will provide what you want but don't have a unified team or financial background to achieve your goal.  Companies will also hand off projects once in the que to another person, hence down a long path you go of many contacts to keep track of to keep your project on target......NOT WITH DIRECT ENERGY SOLAR.  Direct Energy Solar was able to achieve ALL of our requirements, made us feel comfortable with the entire process by keeping us in the loop from day one.

They pre-certify these companies and there are site reviews of them.  GR8 Energy was one of the first to bid.  As with the others that bid, I also went to Yelp for additional reviews that ranked GR8 Energy high.  I then made contact with John Christ, who was very responsive, informative and friendly.

John said it might be possible, but we would have to get started.  He was willing to come out to put together a proposal during the Labor Day weekend and was responsive as we went back and forth on questions that whole weekend.

I want to thank everyone involved at UEC with helping our project run smoothly and meet the deadline.  It was definitely the right decision and we could not have picked a better company.  We are extremely satisfied and highly recommend UEC Solar!

Having received an estimate the previous year from another company, we were pleased that the proposal from BE was approximately 50% less. Our contact with BE was Nic Ponzio. He came to our house to gather information on our needs then returned with a detailed proposal and answered all the questions we had. The installation was done by a local electrical contractor, Cummings Electric, and supervised every step of the way by Nic. We were up and running immediately, with access to a monitoring portal from SolarEdge.

We have not had any technical problems with the equipment in the last year. However, the meter had to be reconfigured since we wanted the solar credits to go directly to our daughter and son-in-law in the house next door. Building Energy took the lead on making this happen and helped with our negotiations with Burlington Electric, the local utility. Though it took a while to get this straightened out, we were pleased that BE stuck with us and again supervised the work.

2104,2112,6200,"RGS offered  the lowest price per watt (which is what you should be looking for).   All the other companies we looked at had been in business less than 2 years.  RGS has 38 years of experience and a great consumer track record.

Every step from initial quote through installation and scheduling hook-up with the electric company, RGS has been quick, informative, professional, and courteous.  Importantly, they knew the most about helping us select between the choice of 2 Rhode Island State incentives for going solar.

The quotes we got from door-to-door salesmen from other companies turned out to be over $4,000 more than what RGS offered.  

The RGS team has provided exceptional service.  Their reps in Colorado, New York, and here in Rhode Island are seemlessly connected- each knew what the others had done with our project.  The installation team took time to explain the system, had it up in a day and a half, and were courteous and neat.

The micro-inverters RGS provides on each solar panel, instead of the single large inverter offered by other companies, is another plus.  It avoids a single point of failure on the solar component most likely to fail- if one inverter fails, the other 23 panels keep producing electricity!

If you're from Rhode Island, you REALLY need to look into installing solar.  We have the most generous incentives of any State.  Added to the 30% federal tax credit (that gives you back 30% of the installation cost when you next file your taxes) solar is a fantastic rate of return on investment.  BUT- the federal incentive may not be renewed after 2018, and the Rhode Island 34 cent payback from the electric company will be reduced in future years.  Long and Short: go solar now if you can!

Read the Consumer Reports article on solar installation that's free on-line, sign up with Energy Sage to get quotes that can be easily compared.  That's the best way to make good decision on which company to select.  For us, RGS was the best, and our experience proves we made a great choice.

Kasselman Solar was on par with most of the 5 quotes (3 of 5 were all within $2K of each other), but they were the company that didn't push to set up a call ""right away"".  From the start, Adam Jordan was thorough with his explanation of the system, rebate/savings incentives, and discussion of the whole process from chatting about what it took to Allison coming out and plugging in the final component.  Cost was the big concern and in the long run, I will pay about half of the quoted system after rebates and tax returns.  I really wanted the array on our barn so it was less visible.  The metal roof was no concern.  Kasselman frequently works with people across NY so my home (southeast of Syracuse) wasn't out of their customer radius at all.  I am so happy we installed solar and even with this rainy spring are producing well above our monthly draw which will be a nice ""bank"" for the shorter, cloudier winter months.  The team at Kasselman was very accommodating in my request to talk over email (vs phone) so I had an exact record of what was said to discuss with my husband, to work with my work schedule (and not needing me at the house during the whole install), and in following up with any concerns or questions after the system had been running.",5,0.8185

It's been over 18 months+ since we've had solar panels installed on our newly remodeled home and we love it. The whole process was 5-star quality -- from the moment we signed the agreement, to the day of installation (took 2 days to complete the job), to getting the sign off from the city, to any follow up communications. The setup we went with included 20 LG 300N1C and 20 Enphase inverters which produces 9,272 kWh/Year. 

Before we pulled the trigger to purchase solar panels, we requested quotes from multiple companies, including Highlight Solar. We made sure we were comparing apples to apples before making our decision as there are so many panel companies out there. We saw the purchase of our solar panels as an investment, and trying to save few hundred dollars off the cost of the panels was not our goal. At the end of the day, Highlight Solar separated themselves from the others with their great customer service (Quang and Dean, the owner), as well as their product offerings.  Dean is extremely knowledgeable about the industry and stands by his products, which was the biggest selling point for us.

I started looking for a new solar installer and I had done my homework by getting 4-5 quotes (Including my original installers) This was when I stumbled on Highlight Solar. Their quote was not only the cheapest, but I managed to get an apple2apple comparison. 

Highlight Solar had quoted me a 7KWh system for $6K less than the nearest quote. (All similar equipment and warranty). I expanded my original 5KWh system which I installed 7 years earlier with an enphase system. 

I was so satisfied with Highlight Solar that I used them over twice so far.
I had them replace my old inverter from the old system with a 15 year warranty this time. I also have a Battery Back up system installed now (using the new SMA inverter). and I had recently expanded the new system with en extra 1.7KWh system because PGE forced changed me from E7 to E6 last year which lowered my benefit and I had to pay $900 extra this year because of that change.

I sincerely feel that Dean, Ali,  Jesse ,  Doug and Sam guided me through the process well from getting to cost benefit/payback period nailed down ,  to site survey and electricity bill analysis done for ensure the proper sizing ,  to permitting ,  to picking the right solar materials ,  to setting up monitoring (pretty cool) ,  to getting all the after install paperwork done so that PG&E is in the loop and we get the benefit of the solar system.

Highlight Solar did a wonderful job in guiding me through all things solar . All aspects of my solar installation from helping to understand education myself in terms of the best combination of solar panels ,  inverters (sunlight to AC electricity ) and racking (to hold the system on the roof with water proofing ).  I have a tile roof so I was concerned about keeping my tiles intact .  There are special hooks for that.

Dean recommended a successful local Hayward racking company called IronRidge .  For inverters,  Dean had SolarEdge based in Fremont with award winning technology for residential with a monitoring app for every solar panel.

Doug and company were polite and patient with me explaining to me what steps were being taken on my roof. He explained the process and what was going on to my wife.

Ali helped to get the permitting which didn't take very long at all.

My current electricity bill is -$10 and we have been running out air conditioning to our hearts delight .


This is one of the type of projects where you need the right material at the right time installed/designed/ followed upon by the right people.  Highlight Solar is high integrity ,  value priced ,  and technically competent company who played with teamwork that you don't see often.

We were looking for a good quality system and clean professional installation within the stated time frame and this is exactly what we got. 
 
Treepublic installed 30 LG 305W panel system, a total of 9.15 KW (enough for our house based on our electric consumption),30 Enphase IQ6PLUS micoinverters plus all necessary electronic and WiFi equipment. Our existing electric panel (125 Amp) had to be upgraded to (200 Amp) as well and a new one got installed by Treepublic. We are very impressed by how ecstatically pleasing the solar panels look on our roof and all boxes on the wall – we can’t even tell apart the new stucco around the new electric panel from the original stucco. 
 
All steps of the project, survey, design/engineering, permitting, installation, system monitoring setup, as well as electric system upgrade went smoothly - all done by Treepublic without any involvement on our part. The all black LG panels blend very well with our roof’s grayish tiles. Treepublic even painted all electric conduits to match the color of the tiles on our roof.
 
Our system is up and running and are truly happy we are generating our own power. We can monitor the quantity of electricity our solar system is producing every day. In fact, production is represented by a nice clear graph on our cell phone Apps. Also, we can see the total production of the day in KWh which is updated every 15 minutes.
 
We found Omar to be very knowledgeable and easy to communicate with. He seems to know his business very well and spent enough time with us to explain the project and answer all our questions. We have had several projects in our home and we can easily say that our experience with Treepublic was stress-free and very satisfactory.

We financed our solar panels as it was the most convenient, and everything was pretty much online.

And when the new battery system becomes available, we will use them to install it.",5,0.6249
2208,2216,21294,"Evoke Solar installed a 12.42kw system consisting of 36 SunPower 345w panels on the roof of my home last summer. They used SolarEdge technology for the inverter and to optimize and monitor each panel.

The system has been cranking out power, and I love being able to monitor generation on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis with the SolarEdge app. I pruned a tree in the backyard and saw the difference on a panel that was being shaded. 

I met with 4 different solar installers before hiring Evoke. I knew SunPower was a premium product but I want my panels to last, and the warranty meant a lot -- not to mention the aesthetics of these panels, plus the high efficiency. 

Wes was highly professional incredibly friendly, and as I met other companies and did research online, I grew to understand just how knowledgeable he was. He modeled out probably a dozen different approaches to our installation, including using other brands of panels, different Sunpower panels (315/365 I think), and helped me understand all the numbers and optimize the setup to get the most value.

He was easy to communicate with by email and text message throughout the process, and along with Roshelle, Evoke was patient with all my questions, and kept me informed throughout the permitting process. 

The whole experience was really the opposite of the impersonal, corporate approach that many big solar installers employ. There was no hard sell, no strong-arm sales tactics and no misleading information -- I really felt Wes was helping me plan this project with the same directness as though I were a family member, or if he were installing solar on his own roof. In addition, he was friendly to my dog and my kids every time he visited, and he and his installation team were conscientious and respectful of our house and property, which included treading carefully around a basement refinishing project that was going on at the same time. 

Highly recommended. Call Evoke.",5,0.7717

Through the whole process he was not only knowledgeable, but proactive about making sure I knew as much as I could about the technology, the choices available and the installation procedure. Even after he knew I wasn't going to be his customer personally, Anil made it clear he was still available to answer questions and gave me a few insights on how to get the best service possible from the other company - obviously his first priority is doing the best possible job and ensuring people get the best solar PV system they can.

He then started work on the plans and paperwork. When the addition was ready I notified Wes and the installation of my new system was completed in one day with Wes on the roof the whole time supervising his crew. All wiring was completely concealed within the new construction (no exposed PVC pipes). The other great thing about working with EVOKE solar is the office Manager Roshelle.

2217,2225,21538,"Due to the unorganized disposition of Rethink Electric, our solar implementation had serious issues.  I will identify just three of the issues here--(1) due to the inability to manage paperwork such as proposals and invoices, the owner of Rethink Electric asked for several thousand additional dollars AFTER we had paid for our implementation in full.  In fact, the owner of Rethink Electric personally visited our residence in order to accept final payment.  Several weeks later, he demanded several thousand additional dollars due to alleged paperwork issues on his end, and he stated that he wouldn't honor his warranty unless we complied.  We haven't heard from him since.  (2) Rethink Electric installed the incorrect inverter our residence.  We had requested (and the owner stated that he had installed) the appropriate inverter so that it would integrate directly with the Tesla or LG battery backup devices.  However, this is not the case and now we must spend thousands of dollars to rectify the situation or ask the court system to assist.  We have written statements from the owner of Rethink Electric stating that he was installing the requested inverter. (3) When the installation was complete, Mike showed us that the electric meter was running backwards and that we would receive a credit as a result.  However, we repeatedly told him (and showed photos) that the electric usage was ADDING (not SUBTRACTING).  Mike repeatedly assured us that the electric bill would show that we were receiving a credit for excess capacity returned to the grid.  However, the first electric bill confirmed that we actually PAID for the excess capacity that was produced, and as a result, our electric bill was roughly DOUBLE what it normally was.  ComEd representatives indicated that they had experienced many issues with Mike (they knew of him by name), that ComEd installs ""tamper proof"" meters that increment even if they run backwards, and that the meters must be replaced before depoyment of PV systems.  Mike said this was ComEd's fault, even though when we contacted ComEd directly, they told us that forms had to be completed and approval was necessary before NetMetering can occur.  We had no choice other than to complete the forms ourselves, even though ComEd representatives stated that this is the responsibility of the installer.  As a result, the system wasn't available for several months.  Although the Rethink staff told us that we would be compensated for the double billing, this never occurred.

In closing, I have two additional solar implementations on the plate (one for a large condominium association), and unfortunately, I have to locate another installer...

A month later I received a letter saying that they are closing the residential solar branch and that they will not complete my system.

2252,2260,22361,"Highlight Solar was highly recommended by a neighbor who used them to install panels on their new home. We were impressed with the knowledgeable sales person. Their price was considerably lower than the other companies with which we met.  We built a custom home with many roof angles and two electrical panels so the installation was complex. Plus we wanted to hide the conduit as much as possible. Their installation crew was very professional and their skill level exceeded our expectations.  We had a couple of concerns  - one of which was getting the two electrical panels to work as one system. The owner, Dean, was very responsive and came out personally to make sure the system was set up the way we wanted it. They have a 20 year full service warranty plus 25 year solar panel warranty.

There were snags due to weather during the install and then the permitting in Boston took awhile but Solar Wolf was there smoothing things out and coaching us all along the way.  They also taught us about SRECs which make the solar investment all the more attractive.

You will be charged the interest every month, and additional principal must be paid on top of it in order to pay off your loan. This is explained almost nowhere on a website that barely works. If you did not have the money to pay it off in full there would be no way out of this type of loan.

2276,2284,21309,"The Good: The construction crew was awesome and explained every step of the install. Safety was a high priority. Coordinated with me on conduit runs and installing the inverter in my basement.

Bad: After the install there was no information or help in regards to SREC's.  I thought I was setup with automatic reporting to masscec-pts, but was not. Was informed 8 months after install that the cell service reporting power statistics would shut off without notice in 5 years. I recently was setup to my router with reports every 15 minutes instead of a few times a day. (recommend)

Ugly: The sales process at the beginning was horrible. Poor communication. Being told one thing in my kitchen and an other after the process was started. Was given a discount after contract was agreed on for my inconvenience. Was not informed about low income loan discounts. They assumed I did not want to attempt for low income discount.

I recently had a service manager at the house (8/2017) to setup connectivity to my router. Looked the system over and we noticed that the panels were not mapped correctly on the layout diagram that appears on the web/app. This does not effect production, just misleading.

2283,2291,22468,"You won't find a better price, better solar panels, more knowledge or better service than Rising Sun EPC.  I talked to three other solar panel installers around town and their quotes were all higher than Rising Sun EPC (for the same sized solar panel system) - one was almost $10,000 more.  Additionally, some of the other companies only use cheap Chinese polycrystalline panels (instead of the high quality American made monocrystalline Solar World panels) and still wanted to charge more for the same sized solar panel system. Knowledge wise, Rising Sun EPC easily beat out all of the competition.  As a mechanical engineer I did a lot of research and was constantly sending Rising Sun questions, which they quickly answered by email or phone (and their answers always checked out with the research I had done).  With the other solar panel companies I usually got conflicting information when compared with my research and they took their time in replying or just didn't reply at all. I was very impressed with Rising Sun's customer service throughout the entire process – they were never too busy to answer any of my questions and they were always accessible. Additionally, Rising Sun's knowledge and experience allowed them to sail right through the permitting process with the city of Overland Park, which I thought was going to be a nightmare since there are not a lot of solar panel systems in Overland Park and the city has been known to have higher than average requirements. Remember when Google Fiber came to Overland Park (OP) and OP had so many requirements that Google Fiber suspended talks and went to other cities around KC instead?  This is why we are just now getting Google Fiber while many other cities have had it for a year or two now.  Once we got through the solar panel permitting process with the city, Rising Sun scheduled our install right away and had our new solar panel system installed in two days. Again, as an engineer I watched over everything during the installation process just like I would for a project at work. Overall I was very satisfied with the install because everything was installed properly to meet code, they took their time to double check everything they did, they were safe and met all OSHA requirements (especially with being tied off on the roof), and everything was straight, flush, secured, labeled, etc. - very professional work.  After the install was complete we had to wait for KCP&L to switch out our electricity meter (which took a few weeks) but what surprised me was that Rising Sun kept in constant contact throughout that entire time and was prepared to hound KCP&L if they didn’t get their new meter installed within 30 days as is required. If you are thinking about going solar (and not having an electric bill ever again) you should contact Rising Sun EPC.  You will be very satisfied and you won’t find a better price, better panels, more knowledge or better service.",5,0.8955

2288,2296,21309,"I am very disappointed in Apex Solar.  To begin with, the loan company: they use electronic documents (which are much quicker and simpler than dealing with papers) and continually had errors.  You correspond with the solar company, not the loan company so it is not easy to fix errors. I had to escalate my concern several times because the solar company was not or could not SEE the exact contract (the loan company was using outdated template). This made it a very frustrating process that lengthened the beginning stages.  Most people wouldn’t even notice, I just happen to pay close attention to details. 
Another overall complaint is the lack of any kind of comprehensive explanation on the process of installing, obtaining approvals, setting up brokerage account for SRECs, and starting the system.  This is just one example….Apex contracted another company to do the actual installation, and for whatever reason, the subcontractor did not contact my township for preconstruction inspection. The subcontractor was aware of this requirement but somehow it was overlooked. This caused about a 2 week delay since the subcontractor had to remove several panels from my roof and arrange for another township inspection.  Once all township approvals were obtained, the utility was suppose to be informed and given 10 days if they wanted to inspect the installation.  Apex did not inform the utility of the completed township inspections for ~10 days.  I later found out this is because they had to submit the township approvals as to the utility and had to wait until they could download through internet. If they had let me know, I would have provided them with the approvals I had in my possession.

In addition, he did not inundate my wife and I with follow up calls and emails on an hourly basis like some of the other providers we contacted.  Ross and his team seemed to know that this was a major project for us, and allowed us the time we needed to make an informed and proper decision.

I would recommend GR8 Energy to anyone looking for an honest, courteous, personal feel when it comes to purchasing their solar project.  I would be happy to personally vouch for their service and workmanship!

2305,2314,22686,"I stumbled on EnergySage, for which I thank thank my lucky stars, because it led me to Gr8 Energy.

This was one of the easiest project/major purchases I'd ever experienced.  Working with Gr8 Energy is like buying car through Fleet as opposed to haggling and dealing with the sales games of the regular car sales department.  I had solar installed on our house at the same time or a little after a bunch of my friends got solar for their homes (and I would've recommended Gr8 Energy to them if they lived in SoCal), and my experience was so different from theirs that they're jealous.  

I dealt primarily with Ross as my contact person.  We first spent about 2 weeks emailing about what system I should get for my house.  His opening suggestion was a smaller system than we'd wanted (I'd forgotten to tell him we want to eventually trade in our ICE cars for EVs), using a string inverter when we wanted the new-fangled microinverters (which cost more and most companies try to upsell to that right away), so I knew right off the bat that Ross was trying to figure out what we NEEDED as opposed to what he could get out of us.  He priced the system reasonably, made the changes I requested (bigger panels!  more panels!  microinverters!), and got me the proposal back within a day.  BTW, I know the website states their work hours, but I've gotten quick email responses from Ross late evenings, on weekends, early mornings.  Late in the planning stage, I changed my mind and went with his original suggestion of a string inverter based on the fact that all the panels are able to fit on one plane on our roof, string inverters are more market-proven, it has a hefty warranty, it costs less, and the particular system Ross recommended gives us a designated outlet for electricity use even when The Grid goes down in a power outage (our neighborhood had a power outage during the planning stages of our solar project and my husband freaked out about his salt water tank fish dying from the pumps stopping).  I told my friends about this feature, and they'd never even heard of it and now they regret some of their decisions.  So Ross amended the proposal and modified our system once again, into a beefed-up version of the one he'd recommended to begin with.  I felt a little sheepish about that, and he proved himself the expert, but the entire time, he was really, really nice about all my back-and-forths on decisions and didn't give me any problems nor delays whatsoever.

So, 2 weeks for me to figure out what I want and commit to a proposal.  Then Gr8 Energy did all the permits, got approvals from the City for the project, opened up the net metering request from SoCal Edison (SCE), all of which took maybe a few days, but less than a week.  My HOA gave approval to the project based on Gr8 Energy's written plans in a week.  Then Gr8 Energy immediately went to work and built and installed my system in TWO DAYS.  The third day, someone from Gr8 Energy came by only to meet with the city inspector, who praised their work, signed off on it, and contacted SCE to give them the green light.  It took SCE another 4 weeks to give us the permission to operate (PTO).  

My friends' installers took an average of 1-2 weeks for installation, they had to wait a month or more to schedule the install, after waiting a few weeks to months for the panels to arrive.  AND...they paid more than I did for the same products.  Whereas for me, I gave Ross my bottom line on pricing, he accepted, and all his proposals have respected that price point, with some proposals (since I made him go through so many re-do's) coming in well under the price point.  That's another reason I knew I wasn't going to be ripped off, on top of the fact that all his emails were very clear, thorough, no-nonsense, patiently answering all my questions and concerns.  I never felt like I was being schmoozed by a salesman.  I had a friend start his solar project a month before we did, and ours was completed a month before his was.  (I only gloated a little, since he was already in agony over our price difference for similar systems.)

Ross's helpfulness did not end at at the completion of the solar installation.  I've emailed him multiple times SINCE his job was done, for little things like, ""How long is SCE going to take to give us PTO?""  ""Is that humming from the inverter unit normal?""  ""What was the performance warranty on the panels again?""  ""How come it's been rainy since our solar installation went up?"" and he has responded to every single email with the same efficiency, patience and informative nature of his previous emails.  Whenever Tesla gets their home battery released on the open market, I'm calling Gr8 Energy back.

I would and have recommended Gr8 Energy to anyone and everyone.  I think my coworkers have grown tired of hearing about my amazing solar project experience.  If you think THIS review is long, you would hate to hear me gush in even more detail in person.",5,0.9118
2306,2315,22686,"I’ve hired many companies, and Ross and his team are among the best. I shopped 8 different solar venders, and they knew more, had much better equipment and the lowest price (I saw bids $6,000 higher!). 
They did a great job on our house and the system is exceeding expectations. (SO LONG SCE!!). They were on time, efficient, and left no trace. No one HAD to come into my home, or measure my roof to give me a quote, close me, etc. (Most all other solar companies try to make it real complex and technical so you fall into their sales cycle- truth is, it’s more like just buying a light bulb. How many watts can your area produce, and how much do you need. Pay cash, loan or re-fi. That’s it). I did all on line. Need I say more? 
They did a beautiful job. I can check my production online anytime. Ross’s depth of knowledge expedited the approval and permitting process. I was up and running months before other companies told me was possible. For knowledge, professionalism, great equipment and service- my research lead me here, and I’m really happy with my system and the value GR8 Energy delivered. You can’t go wrong.

2307,2316,22686,"The team at GR8 Energy did an excellent job throughout the process of my rooftop PV installation.  During the sales process, Ross was very helpful in providing information and explaining the details of the process and the various equipment options.  I liked GR8 Energy because they were willing to be flexible about the type of PV modules.  They are not trying to force a particular brand of PV module, although they will certainly make recommendations based on their knowledge as to best panel for a given installation.  In short, GR8 Energy was patient and willing to help me get comfortable with my decision to go solar.  From my own experience, I can say that GR8 Energy is an excellent fit for anyone who is looking to buy or self-finance their solar system.  Very collaborative sales approach, with no sales pressure or typical greasy sales tactics.  

The installation went flawlessly. GR8 Energy did very good work. the final product looks professional and very nicely done.  they did a fine job of minimizing the visibility of conduit runs by choosing where route the conduit, and by matching paint color for external areas.

He provided professional looking drawings before starting the project. The crew was professional and did nice work.

He didn't need to as his team was incredibly fast, efficient and did a wonderful job but it was nice to know he would be around and wasn't just a salesman. The customer service was also top notch.

They had the best deal, worked with us to meet our personal needs, had the best financing, and answered all of our questions immediately!  I worked in the legal field for 20 years and have always been very hesitant and asked numerous questions before making a major purchase.  Ross was very patient, respectful and courteous with us and worked with us until we felt we had what we wanted.  I felt that we were in good hands, and so I must say that  we are very happy we chose them!  He walked us through the entire  process.  It went smoothly and professionally and the workers worked very hard and stayed on schedule.    Our monitoring system is already showing the drastic savings!

2311,2320,22686,"Ross at GR8 Energy was fantastic to work with and we are very satisfied with our PV system.   We got two other bids from other companies through Energy Sage plus one from a company a friend had used.  However, our initial meeting with Ross was what sold us.  He is the owner and we liked dealing directly with the person who owns the bottom line.  His knowledge and informative answers -- both online and in person -- to our many questions convinced us GR8 Energy was the company to go with.  We were not disappointed.  Communication from start to finish was prompt and complete.  His installers were efficient, clean and polite.  
And personal follow up at job completion was a nice touch.   We even referred our friends, who coincidentally were also shopping for a solar system, and they dropped their number one choice and went with GR8 Energy.",5,0.9221
2312,2321,22686,"Ross essentially rescued us. After another company failed to stick to their bid, I called Ross. He met with us, assured us that we could count on GR8 to get the job done right, on time and on budget and they did exactly that. We couldn't be happier. If you're like us and believe a handshake on a deal should mean ""you can count on it"" - then Ross is your guy!

2313,2322,22686,"Solar power is not necessarily for everyone, but for a majority of us it makes perfect sense.  The four part process of solar should be determining, comparing, installing and on-line.  Determining if you need solar is a process that one has to look at in regards to current electric bills vs. usage, how long you will be at your residence, etc.  This initial step should always be referred back to throughout the entire process.  The comparing process is ultimately critical.  Ever vendor will have a different angle and each interview is a learning process.  Do not make a decision in the early stages.  This is one time that a minimum of 4 to 5 comparisons are needed.  GR8 energy stood out in this category as Rick would promptly answer follow-up questions, yet he would not apply the pressure for a decision.  Suggestions and modifications were made along the way and Rick put my needs first.

We decided on GR8 energy based on the following areas that they scored the highest in.  First the price was the most competitive even though I had decided on TWO SMA inverters and a panel upgrade.  Second, time-wise, GR8 was the most flexible in conforming their schedule to my schedule.  I wanted to be there for a majority of the install, although it was not necessary.
The install process, with Ebert and Enrique actually added value to the project.  They were helpful and their installation was top-notch.  From the quality of their equipment they brought to the site, cleaning up every day, wearing safety equipment was without question among the best as they had a significant level of experience to bring to the job-site.
There were some minor paperwork issues with Edison, but Grace handled those promptly and the PTO (Permission-to-Operate) was issued December 1st.  The system so far has worked impeccably.  I still haven't tried the emergency plugs that the SMA inverters have, but one should give that option a serious look for at least the ability to charge cell phones, laptops etc in a system wide utility failure.  
Thank you to the GR8 team; Rick, Grace, Ebert and Enrique for your outstanding efforts in providing a system with this much ease!",5,0.9479

Ross was great to work with and he took the time to educate me on how the system would work and interface with the electric company and what to expect during each phase of project.  Selecting GR8 Energy turned out to be a great decision!   It was amazing how fast our solar project was completed with the installation of a 13.23 kW system comprised of 42 solar panels. We signed with GR8 Energy on the 7th of March and had Permission to Operate (PTO) from SDG&E on the 21st of March.  GR8 Energy’s team was well coordinated and worked quickly to develop the design, generate the drawings and obtain the permit.  At the same time, Grace, from GR8 Energy, moved quickly to facilitate our SDG&E Net Metering (NEM) agreement and the installation of an SDG&E Renewable Meter Adapter (RMA).  Our dream team installers, Herbert, Marco and Enrique did an expert installation.  The installers were very professional and knowledgeable and took the time to answer all questions.

By this time we already were familiar with relevant numbers and some of the best equipment. We had talked with one high quality installer, but the quote was around $20K and seemed high. Enter energysage: within a day of signing up and entering our basic residential information I received several quotes and it confirmed that the first quote was on the very high end. GR8's quote stood out for three reasons: (1) It was among the lowest (~$16K, equivalent to $3.35/W), (2) it used top equipment (LG320 neon panels, enphase 280 microinverters), (3) Ross Fockler of GR8 added a note that showed he had read my desire to still get the system operational under NEM1 (net metering 1 for SDG&E expires in the next weeks). We set up a meeting (4/20/16) and then things started to move real fast! Installation begun Fri 4/29, finished Mon 5/2, inspection done Wed 5/4, and we were allowed to operate Thu 5/5 (two days ago). This was also helped by a fast track system currently in place in the Carlsbad area.

This was a large installation for a residence (14.5 KW) and he guaranteed the first twelve months' production in an amount about equal to my previous twelve months' use. We seem to be on track to meet that objective, with seven months to go.
Ross is very knowledgeable and made several suggestions which improved the system. Above all, in Ross you are dealing with the owner of the business (and his wife, Grace, who handles the paperwork), 
With some other solar outfits you may be dealing with a salesman who does not make the final decisions.

2331,2340,22686,"I had been putting off going solar for many years until I recently learned that the rules for Net Metering are changing on July 1, 2017. I knew it was time to stop procrastinating. I began researching panels, inverters, optimizers, and learned all I could about solar. After that self-study ""crash course"", I had a pretty good idea about what I wanted/needed from a solar generating system. I understood the ""nuts and bolts"" about the system itself, but I didn't have a clue as to who to have the system installed by. I started with the ""big names"" (the ones that advertise on the radio) to get an idea of what a ""typical"" solar installation consisted of and its cost. None of them had exactly what I was looking for, they had limited offerings, usually a single product or a slight variation. Their prices also seemed a bit high. My search continued. I Googled some more and read lots of Yelp reviews. Then by chance, I came across a website specific to solar--EnergySage.com. Yep, more still on everything solar, including reviews on solar contractors. Their website also made it easy to get competing bids from several solar companies at once. It's similar to using Edmunds or KBB for car shopping. I got 4 or 5 quotes almost immediately. Mostly from smaller solar companies that I've never heard of. That's how I found GR8 Energy. They had very good reviews on EnergySage and on Yelp, so I responded to them. I'm so glad I did. Unlike the ""big radio advertisers"" they offered a selection of products instead of just one or two variations of the same thing. GR8 Energy had EXACTLY what I was looking for. John Christ was the man with all the answers. Yes, he was very professional, extremely knowledgeable and helpful; but what impressed me the most was that he always responded quickly to my MANY questions via phone calls, emails and text messages. He gave me solid advice on how to fine tune the system I'd been ""researching"".  He truly understood what I was looking for. I needed a 6+kW system. I also wanted high efficiency panels like the ones by SunPower, but the high cost of these premium panels was hard to justify. John recommended the VERY efficient Panasonic HIT 330W panels with a SolarEdge power optimizer / inverter system rated at 6.6kW. These Panasonic panels are ""premium"" panels without the ""premium"" price tag. That was it! I was SOLD. Amazingly, GR8 Energy's price beat ALL of the other bids. Including those that provided ""lower end"" and (much) less efficient panels that would have required additional panels covering a lot more area, and multiple surfaces on my roof!
  

Remember what motivated me to install solar right now?--imminent Net Metering changes (NEM 2.0). With this in mind, John, Grace, Shelley, Hebert(?) and crew at GR8 Energy worked hard to get the job done ahead of schedule. Every step of the way came together just as planned. Our HOA meets only once a month and the next meeting was less than 2-weeks away from the time I signed the contract to get started. They got all the plans, drawings and everything ready to submit with time to spare. They took care of all the ""red tape"" like permitting, inspection, and filing documents with my utility company. They meticulously handled every part of the project. We were given ""Permission to Operate"" from SCE almost exactly 5-weeks from first contact with GR8 Energy. Phenomenal!
As for the installation. Hebert(?) and his talented crew really know their stuff. Our installation took the usual two days to complete. At the end of each day, you could not tell that they'd been there. No trash or debris left behind, anywhere. I'm a big DIY guy (from auto repair to woodworking and furniture building). I appreciate quality workmanship. The care they took in the installation is outstanding. Even the way they ran the electrical lines and connections is a thing of beauty! Instead of simply running conduit straight across the exterior wall, they took the time (and extra materials) to run it along the chimney and under the eaves to lessen the visual impact. Very clean. We're now generating power and I just love watching the electric meter ""run"" backwards!
  

My advice. If you are thinking about going solar, first do your homework. Understand your needs, then compare everything--especially the contractor. If you do this, I think you'll see for yourself, that you simply cannot go wrong with GR8 Energy. They are not the biggest, but as far as I'm concerned, they are absolutely the BEST!

2334,2343,20348,"Professional group of installers, did a great job installing the panels, but did break a few shingles they did not take responsibility for.  They were very patient with the El Cerrito inspector.  The city said my electrical panel was not permitted and they needed to inspect my hot water heater and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.  Fortunately, I had copies of my signed off electrical panel from 15 years earlier and I refused to let the city inspect the rest of my home, since this was not required by law.  Lux Light was very patient driving back and forth to my home and waiting for hours multiple days for the inspector.  Because of their patience with the city as I had to visit the town hall with proof the city was wrong, I decided to fix the roof myself.

2336,2345,22599,"I am Physician and DIY guy and love doing renewnerable energy project because I care about our environment. I have had an experience of doing an off-Grid 3.6 Kw System with the help of an electrician friend on a huge barn on my farm land in upstate NY. In December 2015, I wanted to install 20 module system at my house in Dudley, MA, but in Mass I was required to have a certified and licensed solar company to do solar system to do installation. That would have increased the cost significantly. I couldn't find any company to help a DIY guy like me. After some search I found Nate of NV Energy and explained to him my situation, to my great delight he was not only willing to help but also was quite encouraging of home owners to do the work, where it was allowed, and cut the cost of installation significantly. He was very open to discussion and critique. He and his team did a superb job in finishing work withing one day, saving me even more money. He was also very instrumental in finishing up with application process and paperwork needed to deal with National Grid in timely manner. They continue to be available to help even after installation is over.  I am so impressed with his excellent service that in December 2016 I asked him to help me again in installing an add on of 10 module system to the original 20 panel system using micro-inverters. Both system are a great success. I am extremely happy with him and his team and highly recommend them to anyone looking to install solar systems. In fact three of my doctor colleagues used my recommendation and have already used NV Energy services and are very pleased with them.",5,0.902
2337,2346,22371,"Before you waste any more time shopping around, read this.  I spent MONTHS researching panels.  Then another month or two finding a vendor.   I can save you a LOT of time.  Simply said: go with May Electric Solar.  I checked them out top to bottom and they are clean as a whistle.  They are owner operated by William “Billy” May.  If you talk to him for 5 mins you will notice a passion for electrical, especially solar.  On top of that, he knows that customer service is everything in today’s world.  Example: he was on my roof during installation making sure everything went well.  Danny Hibbs, their sales consultant, is all about the customer as well.  Fantastic guy.  Billy May's office team was responsive, detailed and always polite.  The installers were courteous and very friendly as well.  It was a good experience.  The worst part… is waiting for the power company to install your net meter so you can start making your own power!  But that only took about 6 days after their approval process.  Now I’m up an rrunning and addicted to the production vs consumption charts on the Enphase Enlighten site.  Making your own power is invigorating.  

Now, here is my advice for shopping around:  First, use EnergySage.com.  It’s a fantastic site.  Tons of relevant information that you need for your search.  That’s where I found May Electric Solar.  All in, I called 10 different solar companies.  About 7 actually replied.  I narrowed it down to 2 of them.  Bottom line is this, EDUCATE YOURSELF!  You must know exactly what you want and only ask each vendor to quote you precisely that!  If they say that can’t get it, disqualify them and move on.  Otherwise you will become so confused you’ll walk away from the whole idea.  Many companies will sell you on cheaper panels.  Why?  Because they make the highest profit margins on them.  Here is what I found to be the best panels:  SunPower, LG and Panasonic (SunPower being the best).  I went with LG panels.  No doubt that SunPower makes a great quality panel, but LG is giving them a hard run for the money.  You’ll get more power per dollar going with LG and the the warranty is pretty much equal to SunPower’s.  Panasonic is not far behind. Most companies will offer you somewhere between 300 and 340 watt panels (the lower the wattage the more panels you will have on your roof).  That’s fine, but check the efficiency.  Upon my request, May Electric Solar quoted me LG 360 watt panels and dollar for dollar they went up against SunPower’s 327 watt panels.  The efficiency is virtually equal.  So 33 more watts per panel for the same price.  Guess what’s on my roof…. LG 360 watt panels.  Best of luck on your search!  ",5,0.8464

2346,2355,21358,"After obtaining 8 bids for solar installation on our private residence, we ultimately decided to go with SunLux Energy. Their prices were not the cheapest or the most expensive, but fell somewhere in the middle of the pack. It was felt their components were better than average making their system a good value for the price.  We also reviewed their business license and checked out the local court records to see if there were any complaints or liens on them, which there were not.

Our biggest concern was our lifetime warranty, light-weight, concrete composition tile roof which had been installed 12 yrs earlier at a considerable cost. Ralph Funk, SunLux sales rep, assured us they had professional people who knew how to work and walk on these types of roofs and that SunLux Energy would replace any broken tiles.  We signed the contract on 6/13/17 and were told to expect the project to take 45-60 days. Panel and electrical installation didn’t occur until 7/27 and 28, despite the fact that Edison and our local city had approved the project in a timely manner. 

When the installation crew was finished I was appalled at the number of black plastic trash bags full of broken tiles being removed from the roof. Not only did they use all of our reserve tiles, but they also removed good tiles from unaffected areas of the roof to place under the 18 solar panels they had installed. 
 
The City failed the electrical permit because a cold water spigot located in close proximity to the new electric panel was not grounded properly and we needed to relocate a carbon monoxide detector 15 feet further down the home’s hallway. This delayed us another 10 days until 8/10/17 when SunLux Energy returned to make the above corrections and the city signed off on the rough inspection within minutes of the work being completed. We were now more than 8 wks past signing the contract and feared the project was now going to interfere with our planned family vacation.

When the roofers arrived, upon inspection of the replacement tile, it was found not only to be a different manufacture; it was also a different size, color and texture. The roofers stated they could not obtain the correct tile because it was no longer made.  I immediately started a Google search and within 20 mins learned the name of the obsolete tile and located a tile yard in the area that had the product in stock. 

The following day, 8/15/17, Anthony, from SunLux arrived early to await the city inspector for final permit to turn on solar system. In the meantime, the same roofers arrived with same original manufactured tile albeit slight shading difference.  It seemed like a very short time later, Anthony informed me that the roofers had completed their work. 

Upon examination of the roof I found several broken tiles simply caulked back together and not replaced. Approximately 10 replaced tiles had bright yellow florescent moss/mold growing on them. Another 6 were broken on the edge that met the asphalt portion of the roof, exposing roof felt. When asked about this I was told it didn’t matter that the roof felt was showing because there was asphalt underneath this particular area. Lastly, a number of tiles, too large to count, and apparently, too many to repair, were left with small corners broken off them. 

 It is also important to point out that when these numerous roofing tiles were replaced, they were no longer nailed into place but instead held with caulk. The old nail holes were never sealed with roof mastic and will predispose the roof to leaking water over time. The caulked tiles also make for an uneven surface when abutted up to adjoining tiles; this will make them more vulnerable to cracking when next stepped on.

 I insisted they replace a couple more tiles, but ultimately gave up on our roof ever being the same as before the solar installation. There were not enough extra whole tiles left at the end of the job to replace the 38 tiles we had held in reserve, so the roofers had to go back and purchase more.

The final city permits were signed off and the system was turned on. I went back up on the roof to clean all of our skylights of dirt and dust from the recent project and to hose off the dust on our new solar panels so as to improve their efficacy. While there, I poured bleach on the yellow florescent tiles and attempted to scrub them free of moss with a heavy duty scrub sponge and power washer but didn’t seem to make much head way in getting them cleaned. 

As I was doing this unfulfilling work I couldn’t help but think there is something wrong with this picture; No 60+ year old woman should need to be cleaning roof tiles on a $17K+ solar job just recently purchased. In hindsight, If I had any idea this was going to turn out this way, I would have insisted all tiles in affected area be removed and stack prior to installing solar panels. I would also insist on an exact date for completion written into the contract.

2349,2358,22345,"I discovered Building Energy through Energy Sage's site, and worked with Nik Ponzio on my house's needs for both a new roof and 5-6kW sized solar PV array.  

Overall, Building Energy was very professional, knowledgeable, patient and understanding of my needs.  They don't use pushy sales tactics, and they took the time to truly understand my current and future electrical needs in order to tailor a practical solution that fit my budget.  I was impressed right away by Nik's knowledge of the process, and the fact that he first spoke with me on a Saturday.  He came out for a site visit quickly afterwards, and consistently followed my MANY emailed questions.  The pricing for the solar install was very competitive and had I been able to afford an all cash transaction, BE would have been my first choice.  
In the end, ironically, I actually chose a different competitor, and did not use Building Energy.  My choice came down to the financing terms that the competitor had that was exclusive to my particular lender.  This is something that is obviously to no fault to BE.  
Then why still write a review? Because I was so impressed with BE and with the help I received from Nik, I feel compelled to write something positive about my experience.  Based on their work in the Burlington, VT area, I have no doubt that BE is a quality contractor with true professionals of the green building craft.  

I'd recommend to anyone to work with Nik Ponzio and his colleagues if you're seriously considering solar and other green building initiatives.

After consulting with a number of solar companies, I settled with Solar-Fit as the solar company of choice.  They answered  my questions on the benefits of such a system,  how it would be retrofit to my existing hot water system and the expected savings.  Since 2011 when the system was added to the home, everything they described was correct.  After all, solar can be a mystery in itself on what the overall benefits will be for the home owner.  I know for myself that for such a small panel, it makes more than enough hot water to sustain a household of four! Moreover, the circuit breaker for my electric water heater has been off for the longest time. 
 
With the solar hot water heater exceeding my expectations, I decided to venture into PV.  With the plethora of many solar companies providing such products and services, I went with Solar-Fit.  After all, the hot water heater has been working way beyond my expectations and their detail to installation and service has been impeccable.  When I ventured into PV my initial installation was 14 panels.  By some, this is considered a small producing installation but also a way for me to test the benefits of what the technology has to offer.  Since the success of that installation, I have had Solar-Fit add additional panels bringing additional savings to the household.
 
As you can tell, my investment has been over time starting out with just a simple solar water heater.  From that one installation I continue to put my trust in Solar-Fit for providing cutting edge products, clean installations and dependable service.

What really impressed me was the complete openness of the salesperson who told me upfront there would be a period of time before any real progress since the structural and engineering drawings took time to prepare. Treepublic’s rep also offered me the opportunity to come and see other installs underway by Treepublic so I could see the process, at different stages, of installing solar on a home’s roof.
I live in a gated community with a Home Owners Management company. As is often the case there were the usual frustrations caused by delays and paperwork requirements. These delays never came from the solar company, Treepublic.

2362,2371,21729,"I live in the Boston area and don't have a lot of south facing roof area, so solar electric (PV) was basically not going to work.  i have a sunporch with limited south facing exposure which gets a little overshadowed in the winter by a nearby house.  

My regular hot water heating makes me very frustrated in the summer.  We don't have a natural gas line, so the oil fired furnace comes on every couple hours to keep a 'tankless coil' heated for our use.  There's nothing like hearing the furnace come on when you're in the basement on a July day that's 90 deg F outside!   Also, these tankless coil things have definite lives and mine was getting aged - beginning to let water leak into the furnace.  I looked into better options...such as an 'indirect fired storage tank' which your furnace would heat up and then the water stays super insulated and warm until you need it.  This saves fuel and money.   A good indirect tank was going to cost me about $2000.  My current oil tankless coil system was also not able to supply a large volume when a bath or a lot of hot water was needed.  You had to get really good at letting the tub with with a SLOW stream of hot water so the tankless coil could instantaneously produce water in the summer (though in the winter, it was okay, because the furnace is hot all the time).  During the summer though, my oil person said I was using 1-2 gallons of oil a day -- even if I used no water, just to keep the tankless coil hot!  By my calculations the oil furnace was costing me $250-400 for the months the furnace wasn't house-heating, at about $2/gallon.

Over the years I'd been thinking about what to do to get some sort of solar-powered system in there.  I managed to get my mower running off solar PV, but that is a minor thing.

I went to a local solar PV place (Sunbug Solar) and asked about this and they directed me to New England Solar Hot Water, for 'the other solar' - hot water.  Right on the website was a note that pointed out that (as of now, mid 2017) federal and local MA rebates and tax credits would pay for about 75% of the cost of the system - and that the final cost for me would be about $2,000.

NESHW came out (an Architect or system appropriateness person) will come to see if it can work for your site.  We discussed several ideas, but in the end I went with a not-too visible installation of 25 evacuated solar tubes on the porch roof.  Tubes are a bit more efficient and a bit more expensive, so most installations will have solar panel looking things, if you have the room.  The tubes just (and I mean by a couple milimeters!) fit between existing obstacles on the roof.  The team of 3 installers did a great job getting it to fit and all were very glad the architect/sizing work was done accurately.

My system is a drainback system, meaning a pump sends the fluid that picks up the heat from the roof up only when conditions make sense to do so.  It's a simple way to do things, but should be very reliable and frost-free, which is important in the north.  The fluid is a nontoxic liquid that cycles through a tank down below and heats the water that is used in the house.  The tank itself can have a backup electric coil (you'll need your electrician to connect that to your house wiring) and turns out to be a super insulated tank - just the sort I was going to pay $2,000 for if I'd hooked it up solely to my oil furnace.

To my surprise and pleasure, quite a few of the system parts were made here in the USA and even in Massachusetts!  In my case, the tubes and the tank were both made in MA.  

My system doesn't payback as quickly as most SHW systems (I think it's 8 years until the heat in my water is ""free""), but in simplistic terms, I was looking at a $2000 upgrade and would have been still using oil to heat during the summer.  For about the same money, I can turn off the oil furnace entirely during the summer/sun months.  In the 4 or 5 summery months, I've only noticed the electric coil in the tank come on a total of twice for minutes.  NESHW's in-house plumber set up valves so that I can 'switch over' to furnace backup as those short winter days arrive.  Oil is cheaper than electric, in general.  Also, as your oil furnace person will gleefully tell you, heating water in your oil furnace in the winter is 'like getting something for nothin' "", since your furnace is hot keeping your house warm.  Of course, you are paying, but you do piggyback on the furnace heat a bit.

One more thing, NESHW offered 'monitoring' as an option that would cost me a bit more.  I decided, being a tech/reporting/geeky sort of person that I wanted to know how my system was doing.  What the extra monitoring money paid for was connecting the solar hot water controller to a logging system and out to the internet via my home's existing router and cable modem.  I can check the system at any time and from any place with an internet connection.  In some ways, the reporting and monitoring you can do with the monitoring option is the best way to get to know your system and to keep an eye on it.  I instantly liked it.  I check the system still pretty regularly with my PC, Iphone and tablet.  If you're the kind of person who wants to see how much heat you've created and how the system is doing after you take a shower or what the pump is up to, the monitoring is essential.

Caveat Emptor/Full Disclosure:  After I had my system installed, I liked and used the system monitoring so much that I have started helping NESHW with the monitoring and reporting - I set up and maintain the monitoring reporting.  You can certainly take my review of NESHW with a grain of salt, but hopefully you can find the information I've provided useful, particularly if your site has similarities to mine.

2365,2374,22236,"I was up and running with Evelar Solar September 2016 it hasn’t lived up to the hype…

I’m just starting this journey of reviews, since I can’t get anywhere with these guys. They do not return calls and never send promised emails. And you cannot get a straight answer from anyone.

So the problems has been more of an annoyance than a problem over the past year, I have not been not able to get any results. All I have wanted is the APP to track what I am producing.. Seems easy enough right? NOOOO it’s not, they won’t send it to me. I have been trying for a year now.. They say they cannot send it to me, only to my wife. My email is or isn't on record so they can't send it, or the account is in my wife’s name, so they can't send it, though I am a second on the account. They have not sent it to my wife and all get from Emily, Julie, Scott and Todd (I think that’s his name was) is I will send it right now, and they don’t. 

Now the problems are starting. I keep getting bills from Rocky Mtn power anywhere from 10 bucks to my last bill of 160 bucks for power usage not the solar fees. So I called Julie; she says send us your bills I will check them out. Julie then said I’ll call you later today… nothing. I called back left a message still has not called back (it's been 4 days now). I called again and spoke with Emily, Emily says maybe she can do this but it will take at least a week… she is out of the office and there is no one else who can do this. It might take longer if she can’t get to it (and there is no one else in the office who can do this). I ask please at least send me the app and again I cannot get it. It’s AN APP NOT FORT KNOCKS, HER PIN NUMBER OR TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS! IT”S AN APP AND THEY REFUSE TO SEND IT TO ME!!!! 

So in the meantime I don’t know if they under built my system, something is broken and they don‘t want to fix it or just what is going on. All I do know is I get the run a round, can’t get a stupid APP and the chance of getting the solar panels to work like they told me they would is beginning to look like a pipe dream. 

So I will keep posting my reviews until action is taken by Evelar Solar to get this fixed, or until I wear out my keyboard. I will keep you updated on how things go and how long until we get this resolved… 

Tomorrow’s post will be about the 3 biggest lies I was told by Evelar Solor, 1- tax credits, 2- never have a bill from Rocky mountain power again, 3- our customer service is the best in the world.. We care, we are here for you.. What a load of BS 

Perhaps I need to send this to Dave Ramsay too…he may not know they are ruining his good name.",1,-0.8043

2371,2380,22391,"Before I decided to hire PLUGITIN SOLAR I had several other solar panel installers come to my house and give me recommendations and estimates. Two of the salesmen represented big companies.  Their estimates were considerably higher for the same amount of panels. After I told another salesman that I decided to go with PLUGITIN SOLAR he offered me to adjust his price to the same amount. That however did not sit well with me. 

The person I worked with, Leeron  Dagan, who is not just a salesman but a professional electrician, who knows his stuff. He told me exactly what he would do and organized a tree feller who cut down an ugly tree, which shaded a big part of the roof and he included that in the total cost. 

Since I was very happy with the results I hired him again a year later to install lighting on my deck, (stairs, around Jacuzzi tree illumination and sconces).  Even though there was a need for different light strength for the different areas they knew what to do to make everything look even and tasteful. I am very happy with their work and any interaction we had. 

After they were all done they volunteered to go up on the roof and clean my solar panels to stay efficient. This and some other things they did showed me that their intention was to make the customer happy. That goes a long way with me and I recommend them to anyone without hesitation.

2402,2411,21902,"We are extremely pleased with our decision to invest in a solar energy system, and thrilled with our decision to partner with Frank from Green House Solar. From the outset, Frank was extremely patient and thorough answering our many questions.  Knowing very little about what can be an overwhelming process, Frank took his time to go through our options to ensure we were comfortable with our decision.

We spoke to several reputable companies throughout the state. Several pushed leasing, which was not the right path for us.  Ultimately we narrowed our decision down to two. On the one hand was a true project manager/salesman that was fantastic in his responsiveness, competitively priced, and promised to stay on top of things as the install process unfolded. On the other hand was Frank, who was largely a one-man show, less flashy with sales materials, but far more genuine is his commitment to the process from start to finish and in his belief in the solar energy benefits, both financial and environmental.  We favored having Frank onsite at all times. The downside to this approach is Frank had to handle everything for what was a fairly large 15.3kW system. Ultimately, it was the right decision for us to partner with Frank. 

As an example of the kind of partnering that worked for us, on the very first day of installment, once he was finely tuning our roof layout, Frank quickly realized that something wouldn't look quite right in the end with our layout. He discussed our options, and the one that worked for us required one additional panel.  Frank took responsibility for the layout snag, and included the materials for the extra panel in our contract and never said another word about it.  I also remember him staying late one night to rerun some tv cables (not his responsibility), so my kids could have tv back on.  That's the kind of partner Frank was throughout.

Frank's workmanship and dedication to his craft left us with a beautifully finished product that is already producing renewable energy at a terrific pace!

I took the day off of work today to finally have everything installed and they called me half way through the installation to inform me that the panels were never shipped to them and that they think it might be another week!  The question is, why did they confirm today's installation at 5:30pm yesterday if they knew they didn't have the panels?  Another question is why, after 9 days, do they still not have the panels?  My guess is that they didn't order them when they should have and waited until the last minute.  They of course blamed the distributer and took no responsibility themselves.  Earlier delays were blamed on Pepco and DCRA when in fact Pepco and DCRA turned around the permits and documents once submitted pretty quickly.  What makes it even more frustrating is that it is extremely difficult to get in contact with them and to get honest updates on the status of the project.  I always have to email multiple times and call several different people's office and mobile numbers before I reach anyone.  It doesn't help that I've had about 5 different contacts since I started dealing with them.  And when I do actually reach them, its just excuses and no actual helpful information.  The longest email I ever got from them was them trying to explain why none of the delays were their fault.  I will give GreenBrilliance credit for one thing that they're super efficient at...collecting their checks.  I got multiple calls and emails and texts and they even came to my office to collect a check from me...and it was deposited immediately.

GreenBrilliance offered me the best quote of any of the other companies I contacted but in retrospect, it was totally not worth it.  I would much rather have paid a little bit more to deal with a company with some semblance of professionalism.

I cancelled my account so they wouldn't keep taking my money out of my checking account (hopefully), but that remains to be seen. DO NOT deal with Greensky.

2421,2430,21403,"After doing endless hours of research and pricing things out, I ended up choosing U.E.C. Solar for a few reasons. The first thing that I noticed was the equipment that they wanted to install, all of which I consider top of the line. Second was the cost for the installation, very competitive with the other quotes I got on energy sage. Third was all the great reviews on energy sage and yelp.

 Now my experience with U.E.C. was great. From the day that I signed the contract they were busy taking care of all aspects of the project and always kept me in the loop as far schedules and documents. The installers were friendly, neat and took pride in their work, for example they matched the color of my house to paint the new conduits  and made same day corrections after the first inspection. 

  Being in the construction industry myself, I now first hand how bad contractors doing residential work can be so its always tricky trying to find one that actually cares about its clients. U.E.C. is a great example of what a contractor should be, client first and do whatever it takes to get the job done safely and efficiently.

I felt very good about our project.  It seemed like a complicated thing, but in the end i have been educated, that it is just another construction project.   It's not like Elon Musk comes and inspects and adjusts each piece of tech.  So in that case, with the equipment being the same, the manufacturer warranties being same.  It comes down to the experience of the company.

While new in Northern California, they have many projects completed in Southern California.  What i liked was that they have an in house crew.  Even though i'm sure sub-contractors that other Solar companies use are fine as well.   It just felt better knowing that these guys are part of the company.

I got the equipment I wanted, and the price was good.  I feel confident in the star values i put for value, service, and responsiveness.

U.E.C. is very easy to work with.  When we discussed the solar project initially, I indicated that I wanted to add central air conditioning.  They told me that they can do that.  In subsequent discussions they told me I could go with a 4 Ton unit instead of a 5 Ton unit if I upgraded my original leaky windows.   They also were able to do the window upgrade.

I was impressed with how quickly the air conditioning and window project were completed.  The solar took a little longer because we had some issues with the roof and needed to move some of the panels.

I sized the solar system so that it would cover most if not all of my energy consumption.   This year has been unusually hot and I wound up using the AC much more than I expected to.   Even with that, it looks like my annual electric bill will be about what my original monthly bill was.  We had a bit of a slow start because of the panel moves, so the first month or two had lower output.   I wouldn't be surprised if next year's bill will be close to $0.

Imperial Solar completed our job in just 8 weeks! Everything!  And they even  did our paperwork. Words cant describe how happy we are.

2475,2484,20030,"We chose Solar Union among many competitors because of their diamond certification, reviews, and good BBB rating. We live in the central valley and have MID as our electric provider.  Solar Union made a 1 month deadline to apply for NEM 1.0 which if you understand is a very important thing when it comes to solar. They also promised a 25 year parts and labor with a performance guarantee which is very rare in the solar industry.  Our project was accepted and we got NEM 1.0! 
Install went well although there were some bumps and mistakes along the way. We were patient with them and they told us they were people of their word and would correct. It took a little time, but everything that wasn't right was made well. Even when this cost the company time and resources. 
We finally passed inspection before the deadline and thankfully everything was up and running. Word of note, be active in understanding your electric company's requirements and check with the lead install to ensure smooth functioning here. Each electric company has different codes and requirements so this part is probably the most difficult. It was difficult for us because we had a baby at home and scheduling around his nap times was tough for all parties. But Solar Union did try to accommodate this although it wasn't always possible as there were multiple work days and corrective measures.  
At the end of the day, we eliminated our summer electric bills which last year ran $475 and $550 in the hottest months. We are producing excess electricity now and our family couldn't be happier. Solar Union also repaired a few of the Tigo monitoring system components that weren't quite functioning and proved they honor the warranty. 
They are overall good at communication and provide quality service. Their price although higher are worth the protection of warranty and handling all problems.  We eliminated having an electric bill and Solar Union provided a large enough system to take care of all of our electric needs (pool, large house etc..) So we are grateful to their work to do this. If you are still on fence about going solar understand it repays in 6-7 years or less in most cases and is a sound investment especially when the panels can produce 80+ % even after 20 years!

They handled all aspects of our installation including preparation and submission of the paperwork for net metering, permits, SRECS, etc. The entire staff that we interacted with including the initial customer support tech, the administrative contact, the installation team and the company owner were always easy to contact, supportive  and responded quickly to any questions or issues we brought up. The installation team worked well together and very efficiently. The system was installed neatly and did not negatively detract from our home's architecture.

Instead they put all the panels on the east side of the roof all the way down to the bottom of the roof, and that doesn't get much sun light.

2503,2512,6519,"Sorry if you see the same review word for word on other sites, but I typed up such a long thing I didn't feel the need to keep changing it. -  Hello everyone! Hope your having a good day! I never wrote one of these reviews in my life so bear with me. First off, my name is Adam. I have a very extensive knowledge in many topic''s from medicine to car engines. My favorite however is technology. I have kept my finger on the pulse of solar for years, because I wanted it and lived in states that had high incentives. But still, the rate of return would have been 12-15years. The past few years I have been busy with other projects; but started looking at solar again THIS YEAR. why caps you ask? 
There is a tiny windows of opportunity here. Its between now and stretches maybe..... 2 years at best! That''s best case the 2 years. I beg you to look into solar again, even if you have tried in the past and didn''t like the price. Big things happened over the last 3-5 years, and more so in the last 10mo. Right now the government is basically paying more then half of the entire system. (Location dependent). But to a point. Federal rebates apply to everyone, if you check your state in sure there are other incentives to. 
So you say, Adam; why now or less then 2 years? Because solar equipment and installation has dropped *almost* to the floor regarding price, and power output. Solar equipment fell to an all time low as of this year. The Government sponsored programs have realized this and have cut the incentives to a point. But the kicker is they accelerated the phase out year by about 5 years as of today! These programs will BE TERMINATED FOREVER. I can tell you right now, with the right solar installer, you can get the best deal on the planet. Remember government cuts it in half... Do you believe that solar will fall 50%? You shouldn''t. Equipment may get a little cheaper, but the killer in the mounting rails for your roof, the wiring, the inspections and permits, not to mention the biggest expense. US! People! We need to pay people to work at that height with fear of falling. Or worse, being electrocuted. These costs will not ever change. They are hard costs that will never change.
So best deal you will ever get in the next 20 years is right now. My 2 year timeframe is a guess, a best 
case scenario actually. They can pull it anytime. Most power companies have gotten green lights to charge every American more money each year with price hikes. The ""normal"" rate is almost 4% a year, here in NY ConEdison is fighting for 10% this year! So lesson learned from part 1? GET IT NOW! Next this is now my complete, unaffiliated, uncoworssed experience with YSG Solar. I had, this year, sign of with 2 different solar companies. One was a fairly well known big player in solar land, SunRun. They came recommended highly. The person who came to the house to ""explain things"" got my vote and we signed. A 2nd company I wont mention, did the same thing im about to tell you. All of these bigger companies are connected to Big Power industry. Solar hurts their bottom line. When I finally asked 10 times I got a copy of my contract ""because at the time the sales people came, neither printer worked"". Cut to the chase. They required you to connect your system to the internet or have cell phone service so ""They can monitor your system, as well as CONTROL IT DEPENDING ON DEMAND IN YOUR AREA! Meaning your own power will be shifted!!!! No dice, and they lied on other things, Fraudulent signature''s of my 83 year old grandmother in fact. NO LIE, ALL 23 PAGES; but doesn''t even compare to the internet clause. Not to mention I could only have 10kw that would ""fit"" on my roof. *Cough cough, fraud*.Tiny bit of background here: 8 years of fighting with ConEdison over my bill. $600 in summer for a 3 bedroom tiny apartment!!!!!! They refused to do anything!!!!!! So they have stolen for me for years and years. No pool, No heaters, No windows A/C, New house, Central air, all energy star NEW appliance''s, LED lighting. Gas heating air/hot water, house was brand new in 2009.
Now enter the promised land. YSG Solar. I received a call in my VM from a solar company called YSG. Never heard of them prior, my mistake. So I did something I never do....call back. Best decion I ever made. 
So now you say why makes them any different then other 100 quotes I got? MMMMmmm.... EVRYTHING. First of all solar can be scary to try and understand, and compare apples to apples. Equipment is a MAJOR thing to look for and what type (not brand) of inverted they use. I will explain that a little further down. 
YSG has made purchasing a solar system as easy as ordering a pizza. Its difficult for me to explain everything, but I will try me best. 
1)I spoke to a SINGLE point of contact for my system. From start, ordering, financing, installation, permits and 
inspection....1 Person!!!! The sales people at YSG act as your contact point. The crazy thing is for tech people, or financial people, my contact knew all facets of the business and could answer every single question without saying ""ill get back to you"". I don''t want to plaster names here, but if your either type of person, you should speak with *Steve* at YSG. Tell him Adam recommended you and he will know why. I am a very tough customer. I want it how I want and to my specs, to my liking. He met those demands and exceeded them. Most people wouldn''t even need to know everything I asked.
2) Price- Here is my system for you geeks out there. I wanted a net zero bill. Meaning ZERO electric bill, not just reduce it. I sent over my coned bill and he calculated what size would do it for you. I chose to go bigger so I over generate if anything. If you shop around the installation prices are usually spoke in terms of dollar per watt. My system, before ANY TYPE OF REBATE OR INCENTIVE was $3 per watt!!!!!! Now get this, for NY residents it dropped to $0.80cents per watt after incentives!!! If you just take the federal rebate, without any state help or other things, it drops to $2 per watt! Beat that price? I doubt it, not with the equipment I ordered.

3) Install time - From the day I first spoke to YSG to the day the permits were issued, system installed, and 
inspected..30 days!! Here in NYC! Unheard of. NYC never acts fast on permits, ever!! Everything arrived at my house by truck the day installation started. It only took 3 days, and that is due to rain, and 1 man down out of my crew. Condition better? 2 days I bet. Flipped it on, worked first try!

4) Your actual cost and financing - I don''t know a single company that offers this program. Its called a split loan. What it does is split your loan up to consider every tax or incentive you qualify for from federal and state sources. These numbers are set in stone by the state and feds. 1 loan is the amount of rebates do you. In my case, almost $20,000. Best part? ZERO PAYMENTS AND ZERO INSTEREST FOR 12-18mo to allow you to get those incentives. If you turn them over to YSG solar finance company (as you should) THE LOAN IS CLOSED WITH NOTHING PAID OR CHARGED!. 2nd Loan is the remainder, your responsibility of what''s left to pay after everything. My loan is 12years at drum roll please.. 2.99%! Payment ? $163/mo that doesn''t change. Oh, that number doesn''t count your property tax abatement for 5 years in some states like mine!!!! 
This keeps your loan payment low by splitting it and wiping # one loan out. If you consider the abatement and money saved on electricity, you end up paying off the system after 2 years, so the rest is free. in my case; over a 25 year period, the system will have saved me $193,000.26!!!

5) Quality - I requested certain types of equipment. The most important you should learn is what type of inverter do they use. If they use a String (cheapest, operates at the LOWEST PANEL OUTPUT), Microinterters that get mounted to each panel, and optimizers, which I have. It allows each panel to communicate with the main inverter allowing it to produce the most power and adjust each panel for max production. Period! This option adds almost $100 per panel. But let me look at what 
every single panel is doing on my roof and if there any issues. I''m sure geeks like me will love that. Panel type should also be highly looked at, LG, Panasonic, Sunpower, are the top 3. YSG uses optimizers with the newest LG panel series out (Neon 2 !!! Without asking! you can monitor your system from anywhere in the world with you smartphone or PC. It has and collects every single statistic you could ask for. 

6) Warranty- This is a big one. how long is it and what will they cover? What happened if they go bankrupt? YSG purchases extended warranties'' for all hardware and an insurance policy for roof damage or water penetration. This gives you at least 2 warranties'' on everything. Either YSG or if they blow up and disappear your still covered. The tricky part im sure you have seen is time each part is warranted for, correct? YSG makes it very simple 25 years ON EVERYTHING!!!! You own the system, they fix it free. Simple. 

Final thoughts - Call everyone else first, just call and see what they send you in writing only, no verbal garbage, then call YSG Solar. I lost 2 month''s of my life because 2 other solar companies. When I say YSG was upfront with me I mean complexly upfront, not a single surprise, and updates everyday. I don''t know how they do it, but they are simply the best. Just for instance, the ONWER of the company came out to see the inspection to make sure there were no issues the customer had to learn or correct. I have never seen that dedication to quality. I know if seems like I work there, but I assure you I don''t, im just finally happy and able to get rid of my power bill, and not giving ConEdison a penny more!!!! My only regret is not getting a battery backup with the install, it has so many advantage''s I couldn''t explain it here, but if your budget allows YOU WANT IT. Thank you YSG for being great. Here''s my system broken down, (My system is huge for a residential house).
16.2KW System
46 - LG Neon2 330watt panels, all black to look better and are over 19% efficient!
2 Inverters - SolarEdge SE7600A-US ( I requested battery backup capability for the inverters, this model is the only one that does it from SolarEdge , its called StorEdge if you care to look it up) Each is 8.4kw capable so hence I needed 2.
Everything installed and wired including fuses, disconnect switches, electric panels , taps, everything! No hidden costs.
Cost breakdown:
$48,000 cost
$6000-8k from state direct to YSG
$19,000 and change in rebates 
$19,800 left on 12 year loan at 2.99% $163 a month. Can be paid down quicker as mentioned above. 
No one else touched this price, and they used all high quality material, no shortcuts, so sales pitches, no upselling. Just exactly what your budget allows and what you want it to do.",5,0.8595
2504,2513,21309,"I very much enjoyed working with Apex Solar. Very much.

It started with Brett Thomas giving me a quote here on Energy Sage. I called him and he was very at ease, unlike other solar salesmen that were either strongly pushing a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) or a particular brand of solar panels. I enjoyed talking with Brett and he immediately hit a sweet spot for me because I had done research and he was more interested in getting me what I wanted rather than what he wanted. Basically, he said they'd install whatever panels I chose instead of giving me a hard sell on a particular brand of panels. This is what I was looking for.

Brett brought my assigned project manager, Kevin Hall, into communications, and between them both I got honest answers (I researched all recommendations until I was happy I was getting the truth) that, once again, were not based upon an agenda.

Given my specific configuration (roof size and how much power I was looking to produce to get to roughly net zero), I chose Silfab 300 watt all-black panels because the price point was great and with 35 panels I would produce exactly what I was looking for.

Once I committed to Apex, things moved quickly on their side. I decided that at 3.5% it made sense to go with a solar loan, and Brett provided me with a list of banks that participate in the Massachusetts solar loan program. I decided to go with Equitable Bank because of the rate and because they have processed a lot of solar loans. Brett let me know exactly how the solar loan worked, and exactly what I would have to do to complete the process--and sure enough what he explained is exactly what occurred.

Kevin Hall was my project manager, and he and Brett went quickly to work. They sent someone to take measurements of my house, which I had also done myself so that I could determine the rough feasibility of the project, and a technical design followed that matched what I thought I'd end up with: 35 panels, with 28 on one roof and 7 on another--all panels in landscape orientation.

I should also add that along the way, Brett and Kevin let me know that until a particular point in the process passed, that I was able to change the panel brand--and I enjoyed having that flexibility at the time because it took a while for me to fully commit to Silfab.

Once I agreed and signed the documentation, which was made easy via online signing functionality, I would get emails for every landmark event that was next up and when each was complete--such as a ""Next Up: Site Visit"", the application for a building/electrical permit, the acceptance of the permit, etc. This was a very nice feature of the process for my own awareness. It made me feel like part of the process instead of the process happening to me with little awareness.

Once I had secured the solar loan, Brett and Kevin wanted to get me on the install schedule, and they gave me a lot of flexibility. No pressure at all, though, as usual.

And, last but not least, I was ready for the install. At the end of the day, once you work through all the choices and paperwork, it's about installation, right? A bad install can ruin a perfectly executed paperwork process.

Thankfully, Apex has a fantastic installation crew (at least in Massachusetts). Steven Coldwell performed all the electrical work and his partner, Dean, did all the panel installation. Both are masters of their craft (figuratively and literally in Steven's case, because he is a Master Electrician). I was a carpenter for 10 years, so I have a very good eye for good work when I see it, and I saw nothing but top-notch work. Dean not only laid out the panels perfectly, but he cut no corners. What I've seen on many solar installs that I've observed from the street are a skimp-job on the rails that attach to the roof and then accept the panels. Dean did not skip any rails--it is exactly as I would do if I were to install it myself. I can literally see that the rails I have outnumber what I see on most installations in my area. And boy does Dean move fast with the install. I've done my share of roofing in the past and I was impressed by Dean's ability on the roof.

And as far as electrical work goes, couldn't be better. Steven used metal conduit everywhere, which is the preferred approach, and he laid out the inverter and shut off boxes perfectly. Everything is cleanly cut and he did all the little extras, such as cutting holes of perfect size and then filling in any small gaps with electrical putty so as to ensure I have a perfectly tight install. He also did a great job explaining how the system works in regards to start up, shut down, the inverter, the communication between inverter and a web portal, etc. I feel incredibly fortunate to know that Steven did all the electrical work.

Thank you, Apex Solar, for taking care of me and my family. I greatly appreciate the ease of the process we went through together, and I will do my best to recommend you for anyone I know that is interested in going solar!

2508,2517,21117,"Nick was knowledgeable and friendly; he answered all of my questions without speaking down to me or pressuring me. The company offered a competitive price, and since they are a small business I felt like I was important to them. The process (which required a surprising number of steps) went smoothly, but not without a few issues: there was a snag with the materials order (the offered solar panels were discontinued, so we needed to choose a different option) and install was delayed. But, when the install started the workers were professional, Jesse (who did the electrical) knew what he was doing and talked me through it, and Nick worked alongside them and made sure everything was done right. They didn't subcontract, even though we had the roof replaced as part of the process.

I appreciated the different options to customize the system and provided very rational advice on choosing the size and quality we wanted to install. We chose to use Silfab panels out of Canada which were a good compromise of performance, quality and value, combined with SolarEdge optimizers and an oversized inverter in case I want to add more panels later. Dejan, Zack and Brady installed the system, they were prompt and did a lot of extra work (removed old solar pool heater, replacing cracked roof tiles, sorting out chaotic wiring in my panel, etc).

They have someone come out to take measurements, but he does not communicate properly with their home office, and they waste your time by giving you a quote that isn't what you asked for. When you ask for your deposit back, they try to have another person (a closer, I suppose) try to get you to change your mind. If you say, ""I just want my money back, or I'll just call the credit card company,""  they ACTUALLY SAID ""There is no reason for threats."" If your business model considers people working with credit card companies a threat, then perhaps you should reconsider your ""requiring a deposit then refusing to listening to people"" business model. Oh, and their prices were 15% higher than the competition. ",1,-0.5423

That included waiting for permits, inspection and an unfortunate sick day.

2545,2554,20619,"I don't normally write reviews, in fact, this is my very first one. The short review is that Celestial Solar Innovations is the best solar installer in the area. Pick them and know that you will receive the best system for your needs and it will be effective and worry free for 25+ years. If you want to know why, continue to the long version below.

We've always been pro-solar, but have always pushed it off for later. I guess its because the project seems daunting with a lot of unknowns. 

How do we get started? How does it work? How do I know what system I need? Do I have to get the utilities involved? How do I find the best installer? What if they do a terrible job? Do I need a permit? Is my roof going to leak? How much power will I really make? Can I afford this? What questions am I forgetting to ask? Is now the right time?

Let me introduce you to Celestial Solar Innovations. I spent the better part of a month researching solar technology and solar installers and concluded that the right time is now and the right installer is Celestial Solar Innovations. I worked with Jim (the owner) from the beginning all the way to the end. They are the best because:

1. Knowledgeable. I had compiled a list of questions and concerns. Jim quickly answered them and described how the products they use were carefully chosen precisely to meet those concerns. Example: I am worried about my roof leaking. Jim replys with a description of the anchors they use and how they are the most leak-proof. He then followed up with a video illustrating why those anchors are the best at preventing leaks. They do a lot of these and Jim is a wealth of knowledge.

2. Responsiveness. I threw every question and concern I had at Jim the first time we met, but ofcourse I continued to think of more questions and concerns as the project progressed. Jim is super responsive by phone and email. Even today, after going live with my solar system, I email Jim and he replies quickly.

3. Experience. The folks at Celestial Solar Innovations were great to work with. They are very skilled, experienced, courteous and the work looks amazing. This project began quickly and finished quickly. They have the resources and planning expertise to get you up and running asap. I never had to wonder when things were going to get started or how long it was going to take to get done. In my case, they even came on a Sunday. There will be no nagging necessary to get things done.

4. Quality. Celestial Solar Innovations has carefully selected only the best and most proven parts that the industry offers. Everything chosen is geared towards having zero maintenance, zero problems and the best power generation for 25+ years. Even the placement of things and how and where to run the wiring is carelly chosen and expertly implemented to keep your house looking awesome. For my house, you cannot even tell that we are running solar unless you go to the backyard. There is no ugly galvanized piping that runs down my roof to the side of my house for example.

5. Worryfree. Jim will be there from beginning to end. I did my research and had a giant checklist. Each item was accounted for by Jim in their process. All of the paper work with the utility, the county, the rebates, the financing, the scheduling for inspection, utility meter installation, approval etc. were all done by Celestial. I didn't have to call or schedule any appointments. Jim ensures you get all of the tax benefits, rebates, etc. that you are eligible for and his staff files all of the paperwork for you.

Don't push solar any later. The right time is now, the technology is mature, the tax credits and rebates will eventually start phasing out and Celestial Solar Innovations is available to implement your solar system perfectly.",5,0.8591

On top of all that, my house was in a fire (unrelated cause) 3 years after the installation of the panels.  They were extremely timely, and fair again, to get all that taken care of.

-Best price found from > 6 competing quotes
-Good communication on timelines and information provided via project manager.
-Best value proposition and being flexible to allow flexible layouts and design to maximize ROI (tilting some of the panels & locating others on second roof).

Con:
-Issue with design which caused a lack of output (shoulder in the production until secondary array was no longer shaded) from 5 of the panels on one of the strings. This was raised and addressed promptly by Sunbright.
-Initial quality issue (SolarEdge not Sunrbight issue) with a faulty power optimizer which caused same 5-8 panels to not produce the first few days compared to rest of the array.

I would have to say that after having reviewed multiple providers and comparing the merits of their proposals and value, Sunbright won out single-handedly. Also in the post-service realm they have also shined and been exemplary in making sure to follow up to any problems raised and ensure that things are taken care of.

2578,2587,20054,"In summary: Go with Green Power, no others compare.

With Tim's guidance I chose a 44 panel 12.98kW system (44 panels at 295 watts each = 12,980)
Panels: Hanwha Q Cell 295 Watt
Inverter: 1 Solaredge
All black panels with black racking and trim.  The panels blend in very nicely on my black roof (if that is a concern to you).  

For reference - my prior home had owned solar put on by the prior owner.  So I have solar experience/knowledge but never installed them myself.

I'll breakdown my review by the various steps needed to get solar installed.

I used energysage to solicit quotes and met with a local installer in NJ (Trinity Solar)  as well as called the big name brands (Tesla and others).  The local and big name companies I felt like the salesmen didn't care to educate me, just wanted a sale.  

Tesla (formerly Solar City) had the appearance of a lower cost system but in reviewing their quote I realized they were taking my SREC's upfront to lower my cost but at $4 per....currently $150-200/per.  Be careful if speaking with them, losing SRECs materially changes the economics of solar.  

Trinity Solar salesman just came across as untrustworthy; he stated a few things in regards to tax credits and SREC pricing that felt wrong.  When he left and I researched them, my instinct was correct.  I challenged him and he tried to spin his statements.  

Tim was the complete opposite...his approach was answer honestly and if I happen to go with him that's great.  I ended up choosing Tim specifically, because of my interaction with him, these stellar energysage reviews, the price / equipment used and I called a few references he provided.

It's important to note, for my quotes, Green Power proposed the same equipment as the big name brands.  So there is was no difference in equipment/manufacturer warranties/etc. 

After choosing Tim, we filled out some paper work electronically and Green Power Energy worked behind the scenes to get my project going.   We went back and forth with proposed layouts, I was very focused on the aesthetics so Tim and team were patient sending me multiple layout options and discussing the efficiency among the various layouts (# of panels on front vs back of house).  

From there we waited for township/state/etc approvals and set the installation day.  I thought Tim was great but the team installing my system even better.  They made sure all of my aesthetic concerns were met, talked me through the process, asked questions and suggested some improved layouts of wires/etc.  I have two small boys who wanted to talk to them all day long, they took time out to talk to them and explain what they were doing.  I gave permission for a team to come out and take some pictures, they let the kids see how the drone works etc.  I realize these are little things but it seems everyone at the Company knows the little things make a big difference with some people.  Just a great company, I can't rave enough about them.  Clearly their focus is on customer satisfaction.    

Install took 4 full days over two weeks, some of which was due to my townships inspection requirements half way through.  The teams installation passed the midway inspection and the final building/electrical inspections on first pass.  

I'm currently waiting on PSEG to swap out my meter so we can turn my system on, it's in standby mode.  So I can't speak to the accuracy of energy production quoted vs produced but will try to update this review in a year.  It's currently October 2017.

2589,2598,21717,"GRNE Solutions installed a 22 panel 7 kW solar array for me nearly a year ago.  I wanted to try a few seasons with the system to give a full review.  So far the system has worked flawlessly!  The online monitoring tool gives great access to my data and I've seen my primary array consistently achieve near maximum output on clear sunny days.  When doing my research for this project, I spoke with close to 10 different companies in the area and GRNE was easily the most cost competitive.  Eric was incredibly responsive throughout the project, including after-hours calls to answer my numerous questions and, most importantly, prompt replies.  He also did everything in his power to meet my aggressive installation schedule, including following up with the city, HOA, and energy provider.  When his primary electrician had to take PTO unexpectedly, he communicated this to me immediately and offered to line up different contractors; during the install they were incredibly polite and diligent and Eric was on-site up on the roof during the entire installation.  I've received my first SREC, power output is exceeding expectations, and so far I've not had to pay for energy supply* since the system has gone live!

*Some words of warning about the process (not the company) though for new buyers.  There may be some bureaucracy with your energy provider such that applying for permission to install the system is separate from applying for a net metering program.  This distinction was not forthcoming until my next energy bill after giving away a month of free energy.  Also note, there is no such thing as a $0 energy bill, at least in my experience; I still have to pay a 'customer charge' for my grid tied system even though I've provided a net surplus of energy so far.  The energy credits from surplus production are applied to the energy supply costs only.  That being said, my energy bills have only cost $16 per month, even during the summer (using energy credits).  This was still a very positive experience overall.  GRNE was great and I’m currently estimating about a 6-7 year return-on-investment (ROI) after the federal tax rebate!",5,0.8591

2608,2617,22746,"I started looking into solar in 2013. By chance the first company I contacted was NexGen Construction. At the time I was in the investigative phase, not anywhere near ready to commit to an installation.

Eric, NexGen Construction's owner was very helpful in educating me on solar. He spent this time helping me come up to speed even though he knew I was not ready even to decide if solar was right for me much less sign a contract. This was in June. I spent that month and July checking out installers and confirming that solar was a good investment for me. I winnowed down companies to three candidates. 

NexGen Construction gave me a good deal. But more important the dealing with them both in my investigative stage and in the purchasing process made me feel confident in their product and service. I felt it important that my provider was a full service company, not a contractor who relied on fleeting subcontract labor.

It is five years later when I write this review. Three of my friends have also used NexGen Construction for their solar installations. I believe they have also passed down the recommendation to their friends. All of us are totally satisfied with the work and product.

The system has consistently been out performing its estimates by somewhere between 5 and 20 percent a month. My electricity costs are essentially nothing now, so I am saving over $2000 a year. This is based on the cost of electricity five years ago. I have not recomputed based on today's rates, but rest assured the savings are greater now.

I did not know a single thing about solar energy until we met with Solar Optimum after receiving a postcard in the mail. Started with a  phone consult then met with Erik who was able to show us what our bill could look like if we kept paying the utility company. That was enough for me to pull the trigger. Got 2 other cash quoest that were almost identical but the sales rep Erik made a big difference. Great service and funny guy.

High quality work, very professional, and everything under his control was exactly on-budget.

The panels they recommended for me look so good on my house (I was really worried about my roof looking ugly :)) and they were all around fantastic. They gave me a SolarEdge system that has a phone app where i can track my production and monitor to make sure they are always working properly. They did a very clean job on my install, even using my house paint to blend all of the connections that they ran down from the roof so they weren't unsightly. They also did all the work to submit my LADWP rebate. They pulled the permit and had LADWP out to inspect in a day. Then it took a couple of weeks for LADWP to update my meter and connect me to ""the grid"". UEC gave me the best bang for my buck and I did a ton of research - but the best part was how nice and responsive they were throughout the process.",5,0.9464

I'll start by saying I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to researching and questioning any company before I spend my money! LivSolar was helpful, trustworthy, competitive, and thorough from start to finish. I evaluated 3 companies total, 2 independent and one big name. I asked all very thorough questions, diving deep into the tech of things and also going into specifics with warranty and what if scenarios. The final piece was speaking to them one-on-one, that's where you get a real sense of customer focus and trustworthiness that you feel from someone. Matt Hosking projected that and more with his passion for what he does. I really appreciated his enthusiasm and eagerness. The completed work was exceptional. I did not have any concerns after all was complete and I flipped the switch. My only recommendations to consider are understanding each home is different and be aware of city/fire code for spacing around solar panels and be patient with your electric company to install the solar meter (20days) for me.

2646,2655,21309,"I started looking to self install solar, I had my whole system designed, parts chosen, and ready to go. Then my town came with some extraordinary permit requirements, so I opted to find someone. After looking at several choices, APEX caught my eye, specifically because they weren't trying to sell me 330w panels I didn't need. Throughout the entire process they were well within their time frames, the only problems I had were with national grid. Powered my system up yesterday, and today, during a cloudy day, I hit 94% of my systems rated output at it's peak. This is beyond what I was expecting and can't express how happy I am. They always responded to my questions quickly, and everything went as planned. I don't think I can recommend them enough. The honesty was the key, they didn't try to tell me I needed the far more expensive panels when a lower output would suffice (I have a relatively large roof) and save me money, in fact, they opened with panel choices recommending the lower cost panels, but providing the option of higher rated panels.

I am beyond pleased, and should I need anything in the future, I know exactly where my business is going.",5,0.4404
2647,2656,21403,"I struggled to pick an overall rating for UEC because there were some greats and some not-so-greats throughout the process. I'll start with the positives:

Quality product - some of the best panels on the market for a fair price. Not only that, they did a great job with the conduit on the outside of the house. Even painted it to match!! That was a great touch!! Nice work!

Good financing - some other systems with inferior panels etc were more expensive simply because the financial terms that were offered. UEC's offering was unbeatable

Quick Installation - It took three days to get the install done and the inspector was there the day they finished and all approved ASAP. That was unexpected and great!

Good tech - the app to monitor production is something I love, as a data nerd. I'd love to be able to export the data for my own analysis.

Responsive - I called once on the weekend because of an electrical issue right after the install (turned out not to be related to the install) and Haim called immediately to make sure my issue was resolved. Thanks! Also, front office was very quick about responding to emails.

The lows-
Processing - I am not a solar industry professional. I know where my meter is and how to read the usage but that's about it. I expected a bit more assistance on getting the process done. Simple example, getting a meter number. I submitted what I thought the number was and even a picture and was told to just call the power company and get the number. The number was in the picture, I don't need to sit on hold for an hour. The number I provided was correct. At one point, I had to email a link to LADWP's website describing the meter number format. I did also confirm it with LADWP, the initial number I gave was correct. I had to reject paperwork for signature multiple times due to errors (one was the guaranteed production amount, others were paperwork for LADWP). Lastly, I had to ping the office to get stuff done. Our meter didn't get installed for 4 weeks after install and I had to reach out to find out why. Once I did, it was quickly installed (after, again, another paperwork error with forms not having been submitted for us). UPDATE: Last step, waiting for the incentive check. Was told all was good and just to wait for the check. Not a week later, got an email from LADWP saying Incomplete Incentive Documentation. Ended up just being yet another typo but again further delay to the process. The excuse I got was that my process was smoother than others.....smoother than others doesn't mean smooth. Definite room for improvement.

Financing - not UECs fault the financing guy was a jerk. UEC forwarded an email to us where the financing guy made a very unprofessional comment. That probably shouldn't have been forwarded to me.

Clean-up - scrap parts were left in our front yard (installation was in the back) which annoys me. It's not hard to clean up. Also, when LADWP came to switch out the meter, they said that the install guys left a mess up on the roof and that LADWP used their own connectors to try and leave stuff nice and neat. LADWP should not have to do that, that's the installers job.

Overall, I gave UEC 4 stars because they gave a great product, quick install, great financing and responsive service. I am fully capable of doing some legwork myself throughout the process.

2658,2667,21996,"If you're a prospective buyer and or interested in solar, you should read this review.

8/13/2017:
 When we were first interested in going solar, we contacted a handful of companies before finally settling with Goldin Solar. Albert, who is the sales consultant came to our home to run us through our options. He's very friendly and knowledgable when it comes to solar. He's also very easy to contact regarding any issues that may arise. We honestly signed the contract because of Albert and assumed that the he was an embodiment to Goldin Solar standards. 6 stars.

8/14/2017:
 ""We are currently running 6-8 weeks from signature to install."" All finance agreements were signed and we are ecstatic to go solar. A couple days past and we have our site survey. I also messaged the project manager letting him know of our preferences just to ensure everything goes smoothly.

9/06/2017:
 Week 4. We receive the preliminary layout and it's completely wrong. I immediately messaged the project manager and let him know. I was told I'd receive the revised plans the following day. Next day came and nothing received. 4 stars.

9/10/2017:
 Hurricane Irma.

9/20/2017:
 At this point, I'm a bit concerned and contact Daren (the owner). He was very friendly and immediately resolved all our concerns and issues at hand. Our main concern was being left in the dark regarding updates with our project status so it was quite assuring to hear Daren himself answer all our concerns. Great guy and very knowledgable! We received updated layouts the next day. :) 5 stars.

10/12/2017:
 We received the engineering plans and give the go-ahead! Next step, submit the plans to the building department.

10/23/2017:
 I decide to check the Building Department website trying to locate our plans for the solar panels. To my surprise, nothing submitted yet. As bewildered as I was, I decided to contact the individual giving me weekly updates and asked for the status of the plans (not mentioning what I already knew). I received a response stating it was in permitting and waiting for approval (which I obviously knew wasn't true). I asked if she can tell me the Process Number so that I could track the status on the building department website. No response. Ironically, later that day, I again checked the Building Department website and noticed that plans were submitted hours after I decided to contact the individual. Laughable. 3 stars.

11/10/2017:
 Week 13. I still haven't received any real updates since 10/12/2017. From time to time I check the building department website to see if there are any updates. We're really frustrated at this point so I email the Director of permitting information at the Building Department for some information and receive the following:
""The plans were submitted on 10/23/17, uploads and reviews were completed by 10/26/17 by the Department.. At this time the plans are disapproved by structural, please click on the process number below to view disapproval remarks. No plan rework has been submitted.""
A couple things to take away from this. Our plans were submitted on 10/23 and disapproved on 10/26. Just 3 days later, yet today is 11/10 (15 days later) and I have yet to receive a single update from anyone at Goldin Solar. I messaged the individual that's supposed to give us weekly updates and she says they called us 4 days ago (didn't receive any call). When I asked which number they contacted us, she said she doesn't know because they called from a trainees phone who has since been fired. Can you believe it? 1 star.

Conclusion:
 We are really trying to be good customers and not try to be annoying in any way but, this whole process of going solar has been a nightmare ridden with delays and lies. I understand the hurricane, some miscommunication here and there, but we were hoping things would look brighter (pun intended) by now. It's very discouraging to realize today is 11/10 and plans still haven't been resubmitted, especially since they are saying that it was a minor fix. For those keeping count, it's week 14.

I did a lot of reading on solar panels and inverters before selecting Treepublic. Not only did Treepublic spec out the best technology for my needs but they also quoted the lowest price per kilowatt. No corners were cut on installation either. They took the extra time to replace roof vents to give me a nice rectangular layout of the panels, they routed and painted all the conduit to hide it as much as possible, and the stucco work around the new electrical panel was top notch. I had my system for a month now and couldn't be happier with it. You won't go wrong with Treepublic.

Overall, the attention to detail from the beginning of communication to the very tail end of the project, was cohesive and undeniable. This made me feel like I made the right decision and chose the ideal company for this specific task. It's funny how some companies can be so convincing in the beginning and just completely drop the ball at the end, ruining your expectations. I can gladly say that this solar company was nothing like that. They remained consistent, professional, and accommodating throughout the entire process. The technician Matt was very communicative and informative regarding favorable information that's usually kept hidden. He explained what we would be saving from our exact model of solar panels. That's pretty helpful information! All in all, they have my recommendation as one of the more reasonably priced and transparent solar providers in Clearwater, FL.",5,0.7424

Seamless process, and they kept me updated at every step of the process from what to expect, and when to expect it.  Jonathan was my representative and he did a top notch job with explaining the process and going over layouts etc.

The electrical team didn't quite until our AC was back on even though it was getting close to 8PM and they were into their 12th hour on the job.

Mike is so knowledgeable in the Solar business and provided a lot of great advice and good answers to all my questions.  He is very responsive in everything including weekends.  He even responded to my cancellation request on a Sunday.  He was the main reason I initially decided to go with Invaleon.  He has great experience in the field and the company employs a low pressure approach in sales which makes consumer very comfortable.  Mike is very genuine and extremely helpful in providing information I was looking for.  Pricing is fair.  The company does a thorough job in doing a site survey compared to other solar companies I have interacted with.  The company also provides a 25 years labor and material warranty which supplement the manufacturer's warranty.  This allows homeowner like myself to have a peace of mind.

However, after having asked them tons of questions, trust me - I asked a lot - we felt that their solution/company was the best fit.

But before we decided I went to one of BeyondSolar's clients and got a run-down on his experience and he was very pleased, so again, we felt good about BeyondSolar. They were not the cheapest, but among the best priced, but they offered a wide range of options and so much customization and help that we felt very comfortable with them. They offer a true turn-key-solar-solution though we financed with SunTrust because we were already preapproved. 

Anyway, the install crew was very professional and polite and even cleaned up everything after themselves and were very knowledgeable and meticulous about everything. They even brought a gas-driven power generator to keep our fridge/freezer and other things powered up while they had the mandatory ""Down-time"" to install the inverter.

First, my contact with Solar Union, Jim, convinced me that they would be able to install the system on a tile roof without damaging the roof.  Then they backed it up with a 25-year warranty.  Second, they offered high-quality panels and inverter.  Third, the company is Diamond certified.  Given these three things, and a very competitive price, I chose Solar Union for the project.  The initial inspection and subsequent installation went well; the crew worked hard and finished the install in a day and my roof was not damaged.  Solar Union then coordinated with the local county inspector and PGE to get my system connected to the grid.  Throughout the process, communication (primarily with Dianne) was both clear and timely.

2735,2744,22361,"Let me start off by saying we can't say enough good things about this company and it's staff.  Whenever you make a large investment like solar you always worry about getting ripped off.  Put those worries aside.

When we decided to go solar, we got 4 quotes.  Highlight Solar was by far the most competitive with it's bid.  Some companies didn't even come out to look at the house before quoting.  The quote was done over the phone.  Not so with Highlight Solar.  Their salesperson Ali made an appointment to come out and look at the house layout before giving a quote.  He got on the roof, did all the measurements, determined the best layout for the best results. He took a lot of time to clearly explain everything about the process and did a multi page, comprehensive quote including what we could expect in production.  

Ali is an honest, caring person.  All of the employees who work for Highlight Solar are fantastic.  The installation crew (Chris, Shawn, Nick and Doug)  and in office people Sam and Jesse were wonderful.  Everyone was totally into solar and extremely knowledgable.  Once the installation crew arrived to start the job, I knew we were in good hands.  The installation and scheduling went as promised.  Highlight Solar took care of everything from installation, getting required permits and dealing with PG&E.  They keep you up to date as to where you are in the total process.  They were totally responsive to any questions or needs that might arise.  No back and forth emails or phone calls to get a response.  They were on it immediately!!!  Although I didn't have much direct contact with the owner Dean, when I did, he was very honest and responsive.  Very accommodating to any need that might pop up.

So, if you are looking for a solar installation company that is honest, professional, very price competitive, uses the best quality product and very friendly to work with, look no further.  Highlight Solar is the best!  I don't have one negative thing to say about them which in this day and age is extremely rare.  Thank you everyone at Highlight Solar.

Aiman & Maan at NuWatt were extremely helpful from the start, even when we were just at the research stage. Their pricing was at the front of the pack, their installation plan and materials were of high quality, and they provided lots of helpful advice in the financing to arrive at the most suitable payment plan, as well as helping plan our installation and structure to get the most from the array. Maan helped me through the entire process, letting me know exactly what I had to do at each step of the way – even after installation, he helped me through the full process and got me to the point that I was finally producing power. They were extremely supportive and helped me out even when my own electrical contractor had some issues with his own work to commission and finally connect the array to the grid. 

Aiman followed up with me to check on how my installation was producing and further providing me with the ability to monitor production on all panels.

Bottom line – NuWatt made my solar install a painless, hassle-less, economic, even pleasurable, experience. I am very grateful for their helping me produce being my own clean energy in the years to come.

Once I committed to NuWatt, John worked with me in trying to built the best system I could get. I explained to him exactly how I wanted the panels installed on my roof because looks and the location of the conduit was my main concern.  Many times I have seen solar panels on roofs and I would say who in the world installed that system. Even my neighbors would say we'll let you be the guinea pig but now they are like wow looks good. My electric bills were outrageous and the whole reason most of us go solar is not to save the planet, we want to save money.  My first bill $41 normally $270+. Originally I was told they were not that busy and that it would take 3-5 weeks to get the system installed but in reality when your dealing with city permits and Electric companies it takes much longer. It is a slow process so you need to be patient. My system was signed July 5 and was turned on September 15. So plan on 9-10 weeks. If you're thinking about going solar now is the time to do it.

When we agreed to do the install, SolarUnion handled all of the paperwork with the homeowners association, permits - all of it, all inclusive in the price they quoted in the marketplace…no curve balls or surprises.  
When the guys came out to install it, they were totally professional - and I was watching them every step of the way.  It was just installed so properly, and it looks so aesthetically pleasant.  They made sure that it looked great.   
I always felt that solar was kind of a scam since so many companies do it.  But we are generating about 50+ kWh’s on clear days this month. It's awesome. Air conditioner on all the time, and we are netting out a surplus that we can use during the winter months when there is less sun.

The cost came up a few times and it looked scary at first and then their representative told me about the Rebate options offered by some energy suppliers (Duke Energy) whom give you money to install Solar, Wow who would have thought, we also discussed Tax incentives both state, SC, (25%) and federal (30%), after which I thought why wouldn't everyone do this?
There are no upfront costs to this the system is designed fitted and up and running before anything is required. My duke energy bill went from $127 approx. per month to less than $8, which is really a line fee. Come on this is so simple, it makes more energy than you use, the leftover power is redirected to Duke energy and they pay you for this credit once a year around March 30th, I'm currently running around $45 per month credit to duke. working out the numbers they'll be paying me $540 in March after a full year.

The crew couldn’t have been more respectful and efficient! We will recommend Solarponics to everyone!,5,0.7683

He came to our home and went over everything about solar . My wife and I had no questions because any questions we may have had were all answered in Josh’s explanation of what we would be getting with solar! The best part of all was that we NEVER felt pressured! Installation was done in one day and Josh was here at the house to check up on the work and to see if we had any questions. The crew that did the installation were professional and courteous . We are now anxiously awaiting to get started on getting free electricity.

They were informative, supportive and responsive through out the entire process.

2791,2800,22882,"Great Sky Solar: great company to do business with. I have a 19KW system that they provided. The differences from the others
I contacted started from the beginning, the others looked at the satellite pictures and quoted from that view. The satellite view
does not have the required elevation detail of surrounding objects such as the height of the surrounding trees. Great Sky came out 
with their equipment and placed it on my roof. This Sky eye instrument indicated exact angle and direction of my roof and a detailed roof
view of surroundings like tall trees that were shading parts of my roof. The pricing was the best of all the quotes. There were no hidden
cost or high pressure sales and they took care of all the paperwork. I was also very pleased at the quality of the install. The communication
throughout the process was also quite good. Overall it was an excellent transaction. I highly recommend Great Sky Solar.

2792,2801,22882,"I have had an excellent experience with Great Sky Solar, from beginning to end, from financing to installation.  Because the financial opportunities are so good in Massachusetts, a lot of second-rate companies have moved in to try to skim off the benefits from unsuspecting customers.  Great Sky, being employee-owned and a social-benefit company, has been straightforward throughout, explaining how their (very good) deal differs from other companies', and showing me exactly what to expect both in terms of energy savings and finances.  We had questions about my installation because my roof is flat, and I wanted to avoid piercing the roof if at all possible  Their thorough, knowledgeable staff worked with me every step of the way to make sure that my system will be both efficient and safe. They have been respectful and responsive.  I am totally confident--having done my research--that I got a great deal, a safe and high-quality installation, and excellent support for the life of my system.

2793,2802,22882,"Two very thoughtful and knowledgeable folks from Great Sky Solar came out to my house and carefully evaluated my situation--this is important because many solar companies try to avoid coming to the house which results in a proposed system that is not nearly as tailored to the site.  They really took the time to understand my unique situation and they were well-versed in the solar industry.  I felt they proposed an excellent system for our house, taking the time to get it right.

The installation was fast and unobtrusive, the array is great, and when the bank we were working with got bogged down over the holidays, Great Sky was patient and understanding about the delay.

2798,2807,22882,"July of 2016 - 33 Panel  array on my roof.  Great Sky did an excellent job designing and installing the system and walking me through the SREC II Market that was unknown to me at the time and had a questionable capacity issue.  I am very pleased with the follow-up support for a replacement LG Panel under warranty and am very happy I went with a local provider for my design, installation and service needs.",5,0.8716
2799,2808,22882,"I really appreciated Great Sky's dedication to putting together a system that would work in circumstances typically avoided by the giants, who prefer cookie-cutter installations. I had minimal southern exposure (but as it turned out, very serviceable western exposure) and a municipal power company where I believe I was one of the first ten customers to make use of a newly introduced net metering policy. My electrical usage is very modest (about 2.4 MWh annually). In addition my application fell into a period of uncertainty for SREC II. Despite these apparently discouraging factors, Great Sky created proposals grounded in measurements taken from my roof, worked with my muni to understand their policies and meet their particular requirements, and kept me apprised of the evolving SREC II environment. Installation was professional and sensitive to appearances (even to the point of painting outside electrical conduit to match different trim and wall colors behind it!).

I was very anxious to keep on top of any responsibilities I had to make sure the project moved forward and was executed properly, but in fact, Great Sky pretty much did it all for me. As anticipated, the system generated its first MWh in the first quarter of operation, and everything is set up to auction the associated SREC and deposit proceeds automatically. Most months my electrical bill is a credit that offsets some of my gas bill (from the same municipal power company).

It was a bonus that the company is local, small, and looking to do the right thing, and not some outfit just looking to make a quick buck in the MA market.",4,0.9072
2800,2809,22882,"Great Sky Solar designed a bespoke ground mount array for my property, and was very flexible about positioning it so as to fit in with the esthetics of the landscape and avoid needlessly taking down trees. Once the project began, the Great Sky team showed up every day for three weeks until completion, and liaised with the local utility company to commission the array. The workmanship was and is excellent, and Great Sky has always been available to help me understand how the system works and to address any glitches. The whole company is very friendly, easy to work with and committed to my satisfaction. I recommend Great Sky wholeheartedly.",5,0.8927
2801,2810,22882,"I had absolutely no clue when it came to solar. Initially, we received an energy audit through National Grid (which basically gave me a couple free light bulbs and a power strip). They told us  that we would be a great candidate for a solar array and gave us a pamphlet for a national solar company. We called to inquire about solar and within two days they had a person at our house and hustling us on how great and how cheap an array would be and by the end of a 3 hour visit they had us sign an initial, nonbinding contract to have an array that offered no information of size, type, or brand. Perplexed that I still had no knowledge of what I just did, I started looking online and came across Mass Solar Loan website that went over some of the benefits of ownership (National Company pretty much only rents/lease out the solar panels rather than offering up front ownership). That's where I came across Great Sky Solar. My first conversation with Michael Monroe from Great Sky Solar, helped me tremendously with the decision that I made, and luckily I was able to cancel the leasing contract with the national company.  I didn't want to make the same mistake again, so I had Great Sky and another local company come design arrays for our house. At no point did I feel rushed or even persuaded to sign anything from Great Sky or the other company. Where Great Sky rose above and beyond compared to the other local company was Michael and Katherine's willingness to help guide us through the Mass Solar Loan Program as well as setting up our array's solar energy renewable credit (SREC). They even told us about loan support through the state that could possibly lower the cost of the system. The other local company did not offer any information on either one of these programs nor would help us through the process when we asked. At each step of the way Katherine or Michael were there to help answer any questions we had. Now that we have had our system up and running for over 6 months we have received our first SREC payment and have not had an electricity bill since. The customer support and friendly relationship this company offers has been the best I have ever experienced, especially when making such a big investment. They made the whole process smooth and stress free. If you are thinking about solar, I would highly recommend you call Great Sky Solar.

Since I don't hear back from them after number of times I reached out, I am going with another company who wants my business.  

Even if I went with them, I would be very concerned about after care as lack of communication from them. 

Maybe because my house is located in Las Vegas, but before I went with them, I asked specifically about local offices and they confirmed that they did.

The problem with the activation though was PG&E's fault.  They lost the paperwork that gave them the go ahead to turn it on (proven to be true by paperwork provided to me by Sunworks).  Finally, about three weeks after I had assumed I would be changed over to solar, I called Sunworks directly and the woman I spoke to took care of the problem immediately, and I do mean immediately!

I tried, but the second system didn't work. I told Solar Chief's owner and he couldn't be bothered to fix the problem. I called another solar installer and paid $600 to get the system operational (non-connected wires and crossed wires).

I have looked for getting solar system for more than 3 years because I will be buying Tesla electric vehicle soon. 
I then started looking for a quality solar energy company to install and provide information on the solar panels. 
 
However, it was not easy to figure out which of the many Solar Energy Companies were the best bang for the buck. 
I was also looking for them to offer quality workmanship and a solid product, so we could mitigate any regret or mishaps. 
That’s a lot to ask for all in one shot, without paying an arm and a leg. 
 
Coincidently, I heard from a friend that Pingo Solar was the Solar Energy Company he had gone with. 
He said that their customer service, quick project close out times, and inexpensive build outs made them an obvious choice. 
I found customers active in Southern and Central California who had similar experiences, all professing a great installation experience. 
Pingo Solar’s portfolio and expertise both in residential, commercial shows - and they even work with solar farms and large projects like solar carports. I had to see for myself.

After my initial call, I was hooked. We agreed on pricing and placement very quickly. Pingo was literally able to deliver all the best things like top-tier products
with Hyundai monocrystalline solar panel & SolarEdge optimizer & inverter, competitive pricing, long-term warranty and solar loan program with low APR. 
This company goes above and beyond to make sure that I am within budget. They are also heads and tails cheaper than the competition.

I have a friend who installs solar at a corporate level (i.e. industrial solar) for a living and had him check everything ra solar gave me and he said they were legit too. ra solar also gave me the best bid package - in terms of initial picture, initial quote and just general first best impression. 

Everyone who is lucky enough to get quoted by ra solar should absolutely consider them and know I had a great experience, even though in the beginning - I was like - I've never heard of these folks. Going the direct route where you're not having to pay for expensive TV & radio ads saves you money! It's like going with Charles Schwab vs. Merrill Lynch or a direct online bank vs getting ripped off at Wells Fargo etc. 

My solar was installed in Walnut Creek and my only regret is that I didn't install MORE panels. My process was quick - from start to finish just a few weeks. Install was less than 1 full day and the install crew (Henry project manager) and Tavee (electrician) were superb. Very clean and cleaned up. 

Also when I bike around the neighborhood and check out other people's solar install - ra solar was the only one that painted the pipes carrying the wires from the roof down to the inverter. Everyone else has raw exposed steel piping showing but ra solar takes the time to color match to your existing house so the pipes and flashing look like they've been there from the beginning. 

Ra solar was also extremely responsive - we did most of our comm via texts and it worked great. 

In the end of the day, I am not worried that I had never heard of ra solar - the 25 year warranty on the inverter and panels is with those companies anyway.

Tips:
1) if you want to see the design before they get the city permit - be sure to ask that clearly and specifically
2) The mounts they use for the solar may not be as flush as the ones you see from solar city - so if you want that 'look' - just tell them. My panels are on the back of the house - so I didn't care and it was cheaper this way. 
3) Energy sage was very helpful in walking thr my quote with me to educate me along the way. 
4) If you think you'll need your roof redone in the 25+ years the panels will be on your roof - ask them to include a dis-install / re-install on your final contract so you have in writing for the future.",5,0.9166

While they were not the cheapest quote, I feel like they more than made up for the difference by their level of expertise measuring and designing the system and then adjusting things to accommodate some aesthetic concerns I had (I have an old historic house with many dormers).   They do, like many residential solar companies these days, use a sub-contractor for the actual install, but he and his team were excellent and I would have never have known if I didn't specifically inquire.   These also had a production guarantee which some companies did not offer.  Be sure to ask the others if they do stand behind their work with the guarantee.  It is good piece of mind.

2852,2862,22361,"Highlight Solar did an excellent job installing our solar power system and at a very reasonable price.  The final cost to us (after the 30% federal rebate) was just under $5000 for a system rated at just under 2 kW.  I also have to give kudos to Highlight Solar for doing a nice job even with a bunch of tricky elements that we had.  First of all we don't use a huge amount of electricity in the first place and many of the companies won't even install a system for you unless you are using a lot of electricity.  Plus we have some shading from a tree in our neighbor's yard and our existing main circuit breaker panel was mostly filled out. Highlight Solar was able to add a subpanel so that we now have lots of expansion capability in addition to the solar power system and the cost for that was about 1/5 of what it would take to put in a bigger main circuit breaker panel.  They also did the installation faster than originally estimated, 4 1/2 weeks from signing the contract to having the installation finished. 

As other reviewers have mentioned everyone on the team was experienced at doing solar installations.  I talked the most with Doug, who has 10 years of experience with solar and is probably the best contractor that I've ever had do work on our house.

I want to testify of the good Loan Lender who showed light to me after been scammed by 2 different Internet international lenders, they all promise to give me a loan after making me pay a lot of fees which yield nothing and amounted to no positive result. I lost my hard earn money and it was a total of 7,280.00USD. One day as I was surfing through the internet looking frustrated when I came across a testimony woman who was also scammed and eventually got linked to a legit loan company called lucky Loan Company where she finally got her loan, so I decided to contact the same loan company and then told them my story on how I have been scammed by 2 different lenders who did nothing but to cause me more pain. I explain to the company by mail and all they told me was to cry no more because I will get my loan in their company and also I have made the right choice of contacting them. I filled the loan application form and proceeded with all that was requested of me and to my shock I was given a loan amount of $50,000.00US Dollars by this great Company (lucky Loan Company) managed by Dr.  a God frank Williams and here I am today happy, because this company has given me a loan, so I made a vow to myself that I will keep testifying on the internet on how I got my loan. please I advise everyone out there who are in need of loan and can be reliable, trusted and capable of repaying back at the due time of funds to contact .com and be free from scams on the internet, they will never disappoint you...
I remain frank wiilimas..

2904,2914,21534,"My experience with Southern Current has been excellent. From their first information meeting, in which they carefully laid out the installation process, to their support in the months following installation, their sales people and installers were highly professional, thorough, and careful. After assessing our energy needs and calculating the conditions on our roof, Southern Current projected that my system would cover 69% of our energy needs. I have tracked the production carefully over the past two years. In the first year, our system produced 71% of our energy. In the second year, which has just ended, it produced 73%. It will pay off the cost of the installation in about 7 years, after which our system will be generating income every year. Anyone who cares about the environment and wants a sound investment should talk to the folks at Southern Current.  ",5,0.5859

The reason is that Sunwork installs only on weekends. So, one has to wait longer. However, the wait is worth. In terms of transparency, the statement gave details of every small detail of work done. The final bill was few hundred dollars lower than previously quoted.

We estimate we are saving upwards of two-thirds of our pre-installation energy bills of approximately $250 per month. Average cost in 2015 with installation is $79.00 per month. This is a 1200 sf block home with no pool but heavy use of A/C in summer and appliances year round. We do not have a solar water heater and still have old, uninsulated, Miami windows. Well worth it!

2930,2940,21552,"I began looking into solar panels back in 2016 and started my communication with Jim back then.  Unfortunately, some expenses came up and I had to delay; Jim was professional and understood.  I picked up communication again in Fall 2017 and after talking with a couple of other companies including a national chain I decided to go with Bright Eye Solar.  I was a bit concerned because I have not seen many recent reviews but I spoke with some references and I did see that that they were busy with plenty of other jobs which made me more comfortable with my decision.
In terms of the process itself, we did run into a couple hitches.  First, my electric provider didn’t approve the micro inverters we were planning on this year yet (was on schedule to be approved in early 2018) so with had to change to optimizer.  Second, the measurements were redone.  This started off to be a good thing as it allowed us to get an extra panel on the roof.  Unfortunately, we ran into hitch number 3: the mounting system was supposed to be one system.  Unfortunately, the mounting system I wanted needed a bit more space and there was a miscommunication that resulted in half my roof with one mounting system and half with the other mounting system.
Despite the hitches, they crew was very friendly, respectful and professional. There was constant communication and the job was completed in early December.  I was constantly comparing my system production to another system not far from me that is about 250 w larger than my system.  Throughout December I was finding that on most days my system was actually outperforming the other despite mine being slightly smaller even though neither of us are in the shade.  It is now January 11 and my system has produced 478 kWh so far this month; the comparative system is only about 400 kWh for the month so far.

So, Efficiency Maine posts on its website there is a two business day wait for loan approval status. We applied for a new furnace loan as our furnace  suddenly needed to be replaced.  It's now day six (6) waiting for a response and day 12 with no heat in our home.  Four phone calls requesting to speak with someone on the loan application department have gone un-returned. The same holds true with an email. Spoke with Brenda , a very nice person who seemingly takes initial calls and sends along messages to the powers that be. The powers that be at Efficiency Maine have yet to respond to us. Brenda twice assured me that ""someone will call you back"" - sorry Brenda, it hasn't happened. Friday, Brenda gave me a phone number of what I think may be the loan agency. I called and spoke to a nice person named Amy. Amy told me at 4:15 p.m. that the loan center was closed but she would pass along the message with an ""emergency"" request on it and the good news that the loan servicing department works on Saturday from 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.  Amy assured me somone would call me today (Saturday)! ""Great, I thought, there seems to be someone at this new number that actually knows what he/she is actually doing! "" Silly me.... Surprise! No one called me back from the new number location.  In the meantime it's now day 14 with no heat. Not a great thing in January in Maine.... Inept and indifference would be much too kindly words to describe Efficiency Maine and its loan application process and total unresponsiveness.

Certifications, experience, perfection, safety, following all laws, codes and inspections, long term commitment and a sense of family.  That’s what stood out to us and now a year after installation and that’s what we’ve witnessed. 

Solar Wolf Energy worked with our town in acquiring all required permits. They followed every code, had the town inspectors come out for inspection throughout the entire process.   Safety starts with their employees during installation, continues to the homeowner and extends to local fire officials by informing them with everything they need in case of an emergency. 

When Solar Wolf first came out to our house, they listened to all our concerns, requests and needs. They designed a system that met what we asked for and never pressed us to make any decisions. They gave us the literature and encouraged us to do our homework and research before committing to anything. They were patient and understand that this is a big decision.   The end product is beautiful, not an eye sore. Every panel is perfectly straight without any visible wires. Inside the house the equipment and wires are perfectly straight, neat and organized. 

Solar Wolf Energy truly believes in what they are doing.   They want to help people in lowering their energy costs and stand by their product, their installation and their agreement.  Solar Wolf Energy isn’t about getting your money and writing you off after they’ve installed your system. With Solar Wolf Energy the job never ends for them. They continue working for you, monitoring your systems productivity and will contact you if something doesn’t appear right. They are always there for you and continue to answer any questions you may have, They make sure your systems software is always current and will perform software updates as needed.

If you'd rather pay yourself, it will be a 4.24% rate. Sounds good, right? Wrong!
When you start making payments on a $23,000 loan at an APR of just 3.99% you'd assume (you know what they say about assume) payments would be knocking down the loan principal. A minimum payment (for the first 15 months of the loan) is just $103. What does Mosaic do? They take the $103 and designate $82 to interest and only $19 to principal.

He will answer all the questions promptly. I met a couple of other contractors, each spending 1-2 hrs at my house. I chose Sunlux because Ralph did not use any sales pressure tactics to get me sign. He was very patience. We went back and forth until I was completely satisfy. Got 5 quotes and Sunlux gave me the lowest quote. Not only do they have the best quote, but their panel is also high quality. The work was done in a timely manner. Took 2 days for the install and an appointment for the city inspection.

2962,2972,21906,"When we decided to go ahead with Solar, we did our homework and interviewed several solar companies.  We decided to go with Sovereign Solar USA; based on how comfortable we were with Patrick’s (the owner) knowledge base, and experience in the industry.  They also had all the other options that the national companies have, including, access to high quality equipment, and financing options, but with a local presence in this area for a number of years.

Patrick has proven to be dedicated to his customers, by always responding to our texts, phone calls, without hesitation.  In addition, Sovereign Solar USA and their employees worked us to get us installed before in the year, with only a couple of months to do so.  This not only included the actual installation, but also getting our Electrical Company’s application processed. This was done without losing quality workmanship in the process. The installers Nick and Kyle also impressed us with their work ethic, knowledge, and customer service.  Sovereign Solar USA is truly customer service oriented, and has worked beyond what was expected.

My first hint that this might not be the right fit came as I was trying to get a quote for additional EV charging and electrical work. They gave me a standard price since then I have found it was nearly double what other solar installers charge. 

Next came in the actual site visit to address my home needs - I had prepared a ""cheat sheet"" with all of the items in regards to what I would like to carryout with the upgrade to take advantage of the generous federal 30% ITC.

The gentleman who arrived was late due to a previous appointment (not an issue) but he only stayed 15 minutes taking my information and leaving with ""I can see that you are not ready to buy today"" Well....I was willing to buy I am not going to go with a company who cannot listen to what I would like to do to my home and also if they don't care.

Bid price was 3rd lowest of 7 bids received, but the Company provided premium panels and accommodated the addition of a circuit, with a 60-foot run from the main panel, for a EV charger.

The company made an on-site inspection prior to my acceptance of their bid.   This resulted in zero change orders and no surprises during the installation.  After their bid was accepted, the schedule of permitting and work proceeded as stated by the Company.  The Company provided a strong labor and materials warranty.

Since I had done some research, the Company accommodated my preferences without compromising, based on their experience, their recommendations on the design and equipment specifications.

The workers that arrived on site were polite, deliberate, efficient, and neat.  Installation took a day and a half.  It is quality workmanship with all electrical conduit being able to be run internally.

3001,3011,20030,"We chose Solar Union because they quoted high-quality components with a 25-year performance guarantee. 
Our home is 300+ miles North of San Francisco, a considerable distance from Solar Union's base in the Bay Area. The company assured us that they make installations throughout the state, and representatives from the company indeed traveled up here on separate occasions for roof inspection, installation, and for the county inspection.
We went through several rounds of negotiations of the proposal.  We had constructive discussions on how the annual production for our specific area likely would differ from that of the coast, from where more specific data is available, and on the technical and visual impact of various arrangements of the panels on the roof.
The 3-person installation crew arrived early one morning and worked hard and cheerfully through the day into the cold hours of the evening.  They also did a meticulous cleanup job.
The Tigo web-based monitoring system came as part of our installation.  The performance data is available online with a twenty-minute delay, and it is quite interesting to see the minute-by-minute changes in production when bands of clouds pass over.  
From the date of the signing of the contract to the submission of the NEM application to PG&E took four and a half months.  The beginning of the rainy season had pushed back the installation schedule, and backlogs in the county building inspections department also caused delays.  Importantly, we did meet our goal of completing the installation in the 2017 tax year.

Many of the companies were trying to sell me panels that would be little more than an expensive solar decorations as they wanted to put panels on the North face of my house.

RC Construction Solar told me where I needed to put the panels, and I was able to back that up with the direction the sun travels in the sky. The equipment that he sold to me was the same price as the competitors, but it was a better value as it had higher wattage output.

Great communication and she even supplied me with the law in FL that I could share with my HOA that documents that no community can impede or prevent the installation of alternative energy efficient sources like solar panels, wind turbines or even clothesline.

Reason #1. They claim manufactured in USA which is a lie, only their research and development section is here, they manufacture in other countries like South Korea, Mexico, etc.
Reason #2. Their warranty states performance to be 92% at 25 years but when you look closer it’s only covered to 87% which is industry standard with the exception of Panasonic being at 90.8%.
Reason #3. They claim their micro inverters to be most efficient which they are when kept at temps below 90 deg but when have you ever seen a roof in the sun br colder than 90??? More like 140+ so that being said their micro inverters run at 92% efficiency not great when compared to Solar Edge inverters running at 99.5%.

You would be wrong! 

There was an error with my credit score. I was told by various representatives that they use Experian. Only to find out later from a manager that a different system/calculation is used. 

The representative who I had spoken with stated that ""I didn't meet a certain profile"". When I asked for further clarification on this, I was told I would need to contact Experian. After doing so, I later found out that a score of 650 or better was needed. I recently purchased a house, own a successful business and my score is well above 650. 

To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I had my score sent to me from Experian and they confirmed that my numbers were well above the needed threshold. I tried calling back, spoke with another representative, who then put through to the ""Director of Operations"". At least that's what he told me. When I provided my Experian score I was told that while they go by the Experian score, they have their own way of calculating scores, so it's not really my Experian score. When I asked for further clarification, he could not or would not provide any further detail. And when I asked if we could call Experian together to confirm what the real FICO number was, I was simply told no. 

The tone of the call was unpleasant. And their unwillingness to double check their information was extremely aggravating. There is obviously something off here and I would not trust them with a $50 loan let alone one for a significantly higher amount.

Steve and the install team were on their A Game from the time they arrived until the final screw, cable, and clip were installed. Steve answered all of my questions throughout the install process and has made himself available afterwards to guarantee satisfaction.

Several times I was close enough to making a decision that I used Yelp to check out the vendor. I read plenty of horror stories that made me put off making a decision - people not showing up, nobody returning calls, installers where nobody on the crew spoke English, etc.

I picked NexGen because their Yelp reviews were stellar (check them out yourself) and I felt that Eric (the president) was a no BS guy I could count on. He didn't disappoint me. My installation started on Thursday morning and by Friday afternoon I was making electricity. The NexGen crew was a great bunch of guys. Everyone spoke English and happily answered any question I had. The installation is very clean looking with wiring going thru the attic instead of strung across the roof like I've seen with so many other solar installations.

The following Monday Eric came by to show me how to monitor my system and answer any remaining questions I had. The HB city inspector came by the same day and signed off on everything. I can't believe how quickly this all happened. I have total confidence that this guy is going to be there if I have any problems. He always answers his cell and there is no runaround when you try to reach him. The ball is now passed to SCE to do their thing with my billing.

I should also mention that SLS beat every single estimate that I got. There was one other company that was close, but they even beat them.

SLS knew that I had to be completed by December 31 and in order to do so, they worked to install the system during the most frigid temperatures that we had during that time.

3096,3106,21898,"If you’re reading this and looking for a solar installer, then I was in your shoes just a few months ago except I went through this twice.  So, this testimonial is very emotional and raw. I’m not getting paid to write this nor am I getting a discount on my solar installation.  I am just so happy that I chose Treepublic the second time around.  I even volunteered to make a video testimonial because I was so grateful for their service and installation.


Having been unceremoniously dumped (fired) by the first solar company I signed with, I had to find a new solar company to complete an abandoned, in process, main panel upgrade and then begin installing my solar panels.  


To be sure, my project was not easy: I wanted to replace my roof, and I had to brace my chimney, and I wanted to run the solar electrical conduit through my attic.  I had roofers, HVAC people working on furnace ducting removal, chimney repair folks, and solar installers to coordinate.


I will admit I am a picky and detail-oriented person.  But why is that bad, when the house belongs to you?  In my search for a new solar company, I looked at the reviews (number and rating), at, the Buildzoom BZ score, the number of projects, the number of permits, their average project size, and their profile.  I knew I wanted a company that had solar installation and roofing offered together. But what really sold me on Treepublic was their description, and the wording in their reviews.  Treepublic seemed to genuinely care about every customer, and they seemed to specialize in cleaning up other people’s solar messes.  Sure, Treepublic doesn’t have a huge warehouse but don’t let that dissuade you.  It is the people that matter the most in your solar installation – the installers and the management.  That is where Treepublic is truly the hidden diamond.  They are hands on with the owner working at your property as well as the office folks.  The installers are super professional – they care about your house and the job they are doing.


When I met with Omar, the owner, I told him I was very picky, and I fretted over every detail.  He said, “no problem.”  I described how I wanted the inverters and the power equipment for the solar panels to be installed in a small area on the side of my house.  Omar had to work around an already installed new main panel, as well as upgrade the existing breaker box (per the direction of the Building and Safety Inspectors).  What he crafted as a solution was truly a work of art.  I am thrilled with the layout. It passed the inspection, and Omar was even able to rearrange the planned layout of the solar panels to accommodate more panels and even change the type of panels at the last minute to accommodate my desire for a sleeker look from the street.  You should see what they did in my attic, for the electrical conduit run.  Amazing!  None of this would have happened with that other solar company.  


Don’t be misled by the number of review alone, and the overall review rating.  As I later found out, those ratings can be “manufactured” by various financial incentives to ghost owners and even dissatisfied owners.  


If you are reading Energy Sage reviews, they use an algorithm to assign potential companies to your request.  Ignore it and select Treepublic.  I know because I didn't see Treepublic in my first search/selection for a solar company.

I asked about the part of the contract that said I would receive two bills one from my electric provider and I was told and I quote "" you can run your AC 24 hrs a day and your bill will remain the same"" this was also told to a co-worker whom recommended them to me. After the install and it was turned on I started to receive bills from PSEG and called code green who said call sunnova  the solar company who owns and operates the equiptment. Sunnova explained to me that I was misinformed and if my panels did not provide enough electric I would have to pay the difference plus the fixed rate , my electric bills are now doubled. I asked Sunnova for a copy of my contract and after reading it I noticed some pages I had never seen and luckily did not sign. These pages were hidden from me so I wouldn't read the real terms and conditions because I would not have agreed to them. My coworkers contract is also missing his signature in the same area and he was mislead also so now we are both filing complaints and going to arbitration. Code green solar doesn't care because sunnova dropped them and no longer wants them selling their product. Furthermore after the solar was live I called about my sign up bonus and spoke to Megan who said the checks will be mailed out in two weeks. 2 months later no check, spoke to Megan again who said I will expedite and you should receive your bonus soon. 4 months later Megan tells me the check will be mailed out this Friday so I give one more opportunity and guess what..No check. 6 months later I asked to speak to a supervisor and am transferred to Megan who then transfers me to Sunnova the solar company who has nothing to do with the sign up bonus of $1000.

3128,3138,20457,"I became a GreenBrilliance customer in 2010. Communication was excellent, and we came to a final contract agreement via e-mail. We needed to have the roof re-done before having the photo-voltaic panels and hot water system installed. GB coordinated beautifully with (plug here) Douglas Roofing to make the project happen seamlessly. In 2013, we decided to build a shed and increase our total number of PV panels to 26. GB responded quickly and added the additional panels at a fair price. When squirrels did some serious damage to our system wiring (twice), GB responded quickly and installed stainless steel screening to prevent further rodent damage. We now pay nothing for gas or electricity, because our bills for both are offset by the Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) we earn. In fact, since 2013, we are ahead over $1500 in energy costs. The company has always been quickly responsive to our needs and requests, including assisting with our elementary school solar education program in Sterling, VA.

My husband and I recently built a new home in Kansas City and had the great fortune of working with Patrick, Nick, and Kyle. They provided an exceptional level of service from start to finish. Because my husband and I were in the process of a new build, we had a very tight timeline. Sovereign Solar USA went above and beyond to help us realize solar as part of our eco-friendly dream home. They worked under extreme timeline constraints, expediting the ordering of our panels/materials and completing the installation in time for us to close on our home. In addition to our 18 solar panels, Sovereign Solar USA installed a Sense system for us. Sense allows my husband and I to understand and track our energy production, as well as our energy consumption  - down to the specific system, appliance, and electronic device we are using at any given time. We get all of this awesome information via the Sense app on our phones! This has helped us become more energy conscious, reduce our consumption, and make the most of our production. When we ran into delays with KCPL switching out our meter, Patrick stepped in and helped us every step of the way. The Sovereign Solar USA team geeked out with us by coming over to our house for our official ""go live"" ceremony! It was so refreshing to work with a local company that is deeply passionate about and committed to renewable energy, the environment, and our community. My husband and I highly recommend!

Install was great, very professional. Truly top-notch crew. Mike and Melodie Fay obviously didn't tell them that they all would be fired after completing my install. At the end of the install, however, when owner Mike Fay came to get my check, he told me that he was in the process of selling the company. I asked him if this would affect service or my warranty, and he said no. In early January, 2018, I tried contacting them with a technical question  and got no answer. Calling them got voice mail. Then in late January, I found an ad on Craigslist selling the company for $375,000. I responded to the ad asking Mike of the deal he mentioned fell through, and got no response. In February I emailed them at <michael@spreadthesunshine.com, and told them that I was going to contact the NH Attorney General about this issue. I immediately got the following response back from Mike Fay: "" Hi Mark, As I stated to you when I was last at your home. We are in a transitional period in that we are looking to sell the business. Nothing is official just yet.""

A day later, the Craigslist ad disappeared, and their website also disappeared. I at this time filed a complaint with the State of NH. It has been 2 weeks as of Friday February 23rd, and they have not gotten a response from Mike Fay. Their website did come back up --  http://spreadthesunshine.com/, with all contact and address info removed, apparently to throw their existing customer base off as to what's happened.

Sunpro couldn't back up the great services they offered. On Jan 19,  I met with David and was all ready to have them do my project, but federal tariffs were signed demanding 30% taxes on solar panels made overseas. Sunpro has many panels already in the U.S., so I wouldn't have to pay the tariffs, but my concern was that the overseas company would pull technical support in response to the high tariffs and their warranties would be worthless. I asked David (my sales guy) if American panels could be used. He told me that the only two U.S. companies that produced panels went out of business. I looked into it, and quickly got someone on the phone at SolarWorld to confirm that they are still in business and producing panels in Oregon as we spoke. As of the date I am writing this, SolarWorld and Suniva are both still making panels in the America. David could have just told me that they didn't use American panels, but went out of his way to lie. I asked him and my project manager, Noel, to provide something in writing saying they would honor the panel warranties if the overseas company shut down their U.S. operations. I requested this by Jan 31, or I would need to go with another company to get my project done as soon as possible. I never heard from Noel, and David said he would send the info, but as of a month later still hasn't sent me anything. I cancelled my work order with Sunpro on Jan 31, as promised. On Feb 8, I get a call from Ethan, the VP of Sales for Sunpro, doubling down on the lie that U.S. solar panels don't exist, even though the president signed the tariffs in the hopes that Americans would buy U.S.-made panels. I told him Sunpro missed my deadline to provide the info I needed to move forward with them, but he kept trying to upsell me despite that. Meanwhile, I receive word from their finance company that Sunpro used my SSN to open a credit card in my name and immediately maxed it out. I'd given them my SSN so they could run my credit and tell me what I'd pay for their services, not to open a credit card. I called Amber at Sunpro (in accounting) every day for two weeks to get them to cancel the credit card. As of today, no one has called me back.

(Some of the other quotes were pretty generic.) My consultant, Taylor, was a great guy to work with.

We had a few snafus on the paperwork items. The first contract we signed stated that LA Solar would install a 240v car charger; due to PG&E limitations, we had to re-contract without the car charger. Also, I was anticipating that LA Solar would handle all the interactions with PG&E (changing my rate plan, processing the interconnect, etc.). They attempted all these things, but some of them didn't work. I found myself on the phone with PG&E quite a few times during the process, which was a little frustrating.

Way more important, however: the installation was outstanding. Except for a solar array appearing on my roof, you would not have known the installers had even been to my house that day, because they left the roof, driveway, etc. completely spotless.

The installers were professional, quick, and flexible too. For instance, I asked them to route a duct a different way (for aesthetic reasons), and it was not problem; they did it right away. They painted the ductwork to match the side of the building, to blend it in. They connected my system to my wifi (to support uploading my solar production data to the website), and educated me on the whole system. Overall, the installation team was awesome.

Doug recommended a unique fiberglass ballasted system that was perfect for my rubber membrane roof with no holes required! Nick came on site and explained what was realistic to expect from all my roof shading issues.  I eventually opted to cut down several wild young trees on the side of my house and Southard placed the panels where they could get the most sun.  Because of the tree shading in my backyard and several roof chimneys, I thought the independent micro inverters on each panel were a great fit so I would get the most energy production.  The permits, Xcel agreements, electrical work, and install of the mounts and panels went smoothly and Nick and Doug helped me every step of the way.  For the impressive quality of installation I got and great customer service I received throughout, the price was hands down the best of the 3 quotes I received.  One company was cheaper, but they wanted to drill a bunch of holes in my roof and use a cheaper string inverter, which I felt wasn't a good solution.  Another well-known company was more expensive, but seemed to be more interested in handing out glossy marketing materials and giving me a cookie cutter install than taking the effort to customize a solution to fit my needs.

I've had it for about 9 months now and I love my system!  I can even can see all the individual panel production stats with the Enphase online monitoring, so I know when to trim the tree branches in the backyard now, and see instant improvement in that area lol!

If I had to do it again, I would have concentrated higher efficiency more expensive panels in the sunniest parts of my roof, like Nick and Doug recommended.  I thought I knew better, lol and it was my own decision to go with lower efficiency panels covering more surface area on my roof.  I'll probably eventually upgrade a few panels in the sweet spot later on, due to that hubris!  I never thought it would be possible to go solar with my unusual roof, but Southard was up for the challenge.  For every complexity with my unique install, they found the perfect solution!",5,0.923

3211,3221,22521,"SCAM ARTIST! DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY!

 We inquired about a solar and roof repair with this company. They came out, gave us a quote of $3000 to repair the roof, and another wrote of nearly $30K to do solar. We wanted to start with the roof repair first and then do the solar. Thank god we did, because this company turned out to be entirely unprofessional and scammed us out of $5000. We are now filing a law suit against them.

The originally quoted $3000 for the leak repair became $5000 a week later, when they found “more issues” in connection with our roof. That alone should have been a red flag.

In any event, they offered a 20 year warranty on the roof and we felt good about going ahead with the repair. They repaired the roof leak and not even ONE WEEK later the roof leaked AGAIN.

Our contractor who look at their work while they were doing repairs told them that the way they are fixing the roof won’t hold. They ignored him. We called them and said to make sure the work is done properly. They said, our contractor doesn’t know what he is talking about. And, if indeed there was an issue the warranty would hold and they would come out to fix it. So, we thought it’s a non – issue given the warranty.

The warranty was worth nothing as it turned out because they refused to come out to fix their mistake, when we called them to fix the leak.  They reasoning was “the leak must come from somewhere else”. When we showed them pictures showing the roof was leaking at the EXACT SAME SPOT they “repaired” they yelled at us saying “you don’t know what you are talking about” and hung up on us. They didn’t even take an inkling of responsibility for the fact the service we paid for (repairing a roof leak) was not performed and their warranty was not exercised.  We are now forced to hire another roof company to do the work AGAIN.

Needless to say we will file a law suit against this company for damages they caused plus a loss of rental income, because our tenants can’t live in the home due to the leaking roof.

Thank God we used them on a smaller job first, before giving them a $30K job. People like this are repulsive and its truly upsetting having to deal with such a profound lack of professionalism. 

This company has lot's of bad reviews online ( I wish I would have researched them better), which I am finding now, as I am placing reviews about their practices everywhere. This way potential future customers do not fall into the same trap I did.

With medical bills over running me, I needed to find a way to reduce my monthly expenses to make life a little more comfortable for my children.

I didn’t think having a solar powered house was going to be within my reach but I was determined to find a way to make it happen.  I reached out to Sunlight Energy Solutions, to learn a little more and to see what kind of options were available.  Eva and Cris were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable (and funny).  they answered every question that I had as well as questions that I hadn’t even thought of.  Working with Sunlight Energy Solutions has been an absolute pleasure.  My first contact with them was on December 18, 2017.

I picked OC Solar because of Vincent's (Vinnie when you become friends) great responsiveness and competitive pricing through the quote process. For quotes we chose a large national firm, a small local firm, and consider OC Solar as an Orange County regional size.  Hands down Vince responded to us more quickly, acted more professionally, and quoted competitively to earn our business. OC Solar also completed installation in less than 3 weeks.

We were very concerned about financing, and he connected us with San Diego Metropolitan Credit Union which offers a 12 year loan package secured by the solar installation. Vince's electrician also came back a week after completion to install a 220 dryer plug for a new electric car charger.

Now we are happily monitoring our solar production on the SolarEdge microinverter and inverter technology, and we are very happy.  I highly reccomend OC Solar to anyone wanting to install and own their solar system!

3272,3282,22965,"When I moved into a new house in Maryland I was set on getting a solar system installed. After reviewing several proposals from competing companies I signed on with Nova Solar. From the proposal to the installation to the start-up of the system Nova Solar’s attention to detail was none I have ever experienced working with subcontractors on my house. Their attention to detail was extraordinary. All of my inquiries and questions on the system were answered thoroughly and in a timely manner. There were several tax credits, renewable energy credits and grants that were available for my solar system and in my jurisdiction. Nova Solar made sure that each of the applications were completed and received for their system. When completed Nova Solar sent links to each of my electronic devices so I could have access to the system on line to track the daily energy production and to see any trouble with the system (which there have been none to date) at any time during the day.

3276,3286,21813,"Wanted solar on a 3700sq ft. house.  Started with zero about the industry or technology.  I found Energysage, which I strongly recommend – they are a wealth of information.  They are product and vendor agnostic.  Start there - read and research.  After learning basic information on Energysage, obviously Google is your best friend.  

Once I actually understood how we pay for Watts/Kwh from our energy provider and how solar panels capture energy (high level understanding), I had questions that only seasoned solar professions could answer.  Note – at this point I’m a potential buyer with a little knowledge, moderate doubt, plenty of curiosity and a healthy spreadsheet.  I summited my request for a quote via Energysage.  Reviewed maybe 7 quotes.  I narrowed it down to 4 and started a healthy discussion with those vendors via email and phone. RA Solar was not in the discussion at this point.  Roughly 2 weeks into the process I received a call from RA Solar asking how things were going with the other quotes and if there was anything they can do to earn my business – loved hearing that.  I told them if they could match the price range, products (panels/inverter) and experience of the other three vendors, sure.  He ensured me he could.

Here’s what I noticed right away.  The resource from RA Solar had far more knowledge of the industry than the others; his information was more broad and deep (not knocking the others, maybe RA Solar was willing to share more – which matters to a customer!).  Essentially instead of just answering the question asked, they educated me with ‘critical’ components of related information to think about.  I’m the type of consumer that would research that additional info. and ask follow-up questions, RA Solar (Varney) never hesitated to keep answering my questions.  To expand on this slightly…  I’m the “that” customer that asks the same company the exact same question to see if the answers sync (Solar is an expensive purchase).  Some of the other vendors grew moderately frustrated with my questions and their responses because shorter and response times longer – two stopped responded, I get it.  But I also know these are the types of companies that might stop responding if you have issues post purchase. Varney, however, responded nearly real-time with every questioned asked - for me that was critically important as I was doing my research real-time.  It showed a focus on the customer.  Again, his responses were quality, crisp and thorough (no shortcuts).  Guys, every interaction were professional, total business acumen.  I never felt like I was working with a fly-by business (longevity is important).   Fast-forward, I selected RA Solar and although they were not the best price on the front-end, RA Solar ultimately gave me a really good contract when all was said and done.  EXTREMELY competitive.  I was surprised!!

 The installation:  Quality, period.  For me the installation was completed within 4 weeks.  The panel installers were great.  Professional.  They asked me questions about what I wanted, awesome.  The electrical crew was also on point.  Just a great crew that’s all about customer service.  Installed the inverter exactly how and where I wanted, installed the pipes where I wanted, out of sight, painted, etc.  The overall experience  – end to end was as good at it gets.  If you look at my Yelp reviews I’m fair.  I would rate this experience 10 out of 10.  Ping me if you want to discuss further.  Solar is a big expense my friend, I totally get that. If you talk with Varney, tell him I sent you ☺, he’ll take care of you ☺",5,0.8126

It was a long process but finally glad to be producing green energy. Yellowlite was very responsive and answered all my questions. The original design we sent back requesting changes, that were readily taken care of. Once officially signed things moved fairly smooth. The biggest delay was with our electric provider DTE. They switched to only accepting electronic applications and Yellowlite mailed in, once this was figured out I went in and filled out the application but had Yellowlite on the phone to help with answers about the system being installed, they also had to send documents and photos to attach during the process of the online application. After that was done DTE had an issue figuring out which application check to cash - the one sent with the manual application (they rejected the applicaton) or the one sent in with the online application... Once they were told to use the online check, the process finally moved along. Yellowlite took care of permits and everything to do with the process. They sub-contracted the install.

Through technology we can monitor individual roof array panel generation and consumption down to the individual electrical appliance. Self sustaining and detailed.  Everything was great about the process from design to permitting to installation.  I would recommend them highly to any of my friends and family members.,5,0.6808
3306,3316,22979,All around a great company. From the very start of our journey learning about solar they were super helpful. Great honest customer service. Our sales guy Jesse Kruszynski walked us through each part of the sale and install. Showed us our savings on a very user friendly proposal.

There was a multi month delay in getting the communications to monitor the system. I had to call them several times to follow up on what they would be doing to set up the communications. They finally came back a few weeks ago with an option of running a cable from our internet modem to our barn where the system was installed. The person doing this work fell through the ceiling in one of my daughter's bedrooms. They came back out a week later to repair the ceiling, but only completed part of it to let the drywall dry. It has been 2 more weeks since this was done and I had to call again this morning (left message) to find out when they would come back out to complete the repairs.

We scheduled a meeting with Aviara solar at our  home to discuss the solar system and to show them our electrical usage history .We signed the contract at our first meeting and we are extremely satisfied.
They explained to us how the solar system works, solar benefits, selection of modules and inverters ,roofing attachments, rebate process, design, installation, inspection and timeline for each phase. They were really professional and answered all our questions. The installation was very smooth and professional. We didn’t have to put down any money out of pockets using the financing they provided. Our payments are lower than our electricity bills. We no longer have to stress over rate hikes from SDG& E. Now we plan to buy an electric car that we can charge with our own solar system and get rid of our auto gas bill too. Thanks Aviara Solar.",5,0.5719
3312,3322,22361,"Our desire was to install as large a rooftop solar system as we could without any panels visible from the street.  We received bids from four solar companies including Highlight Solar.   The Highlight Solar bid had several things going for it:  

1) it was the only company where a representative came to our house to take measurements to provide a definitive bid -- the other three companies wanted us to put down a deposit first before they would measure our house and lay out the system, 

2) it was able to fit more panels that the other three companies would commit to, 

3) it proposed the earliest project start and shortest installation time span, 

4) it had the lowest bid, and 

5) it is a diamond certified company.  

We agreed to purchase a 9.1 KW system with 32 panels from Highlight Solar.

Once we signed the contract, the panels and inverters were delivered within a week.  Installation began four days later, and was completed in three days.   Final inspection was completed on the first visit two weeks later (would have been one week, but it was delayed because we were out of town).  Three days after the inspection, PG&E approved our Net Energy Metering (NEM) application.  The whole process took one month, which was half the time any of the other companies would commit to.

Dean and his folks were a pleasure to work with during the whole project.  In addition to the solar installation itself, they handled all aspects of the city permitting and NEM application process with PG&E.  We were very happy with the entire experience, and would recommend Highlight Solar to anybody considering the addition of a rooftop solar system to their home.",5,0.8357

I was thoroughly impressed with their professionalism and knowledge of solar systems. They even apologized for the noise when working on the roof which was totally unavoidable.  Our house was a difficult one since it has several levels above the street and does not have good level footing for ladders.  They improvised for safety and placed the inverters out of our view which meant more work for them. They got the city permits and the city inspector came out the day after they were done.

Other companies spent 80% of the time bickering about their competitors, which is a total turn off! They were quiet, respectful, treated my roof/house like their own (they didn't bang their ladder against my wall/roof for their installation).

When reviewing quotes on Energy Sage, theirs immediately jumped off the page as providing a superior product at a very competitive price.  I reached out for a meeting, for which they accommodated my busy schedule and traveled two hours early on a Saturday morning just to meet me.  I learned that morning that while their current entity (Gold Coast) was somewhat new at the time (August 2017), their guys had over a decade of experience in designing and installing systems and had started their own venture about two years prior.  John and their lead installer were there for the meeting and both were professional, knowledgeable and trustworthy.  Striving to make a name for themselves, they offered very competitive pricing, but there was nothing cut-rate about their service.

The install took place within a couple weeks, and we couldn't be happier with how it turned out.

Coming close to the closing date we just found out that this company put a lean on our property, and with there being a lean we can not sell the house until the loan is completely paid for. Called the company and they told me that they can't do anything but have us pay the loan completely off or transfer it to the buyers. Which the buyers are not interested. It's not worth the headache.

They were willing to negotiate a bit, and once I signed, the work was very smooth and professional from there.

Here i would like to express my sincere thanks to project manager/sales, Mr. 
Silvestre, for his dedicated work. Mr. Silvestre is such a knowledgable and nice guy who has done a great job educating me about the whole solar system and its benefit. After the solar system being installed, i encountered one trivial but annoying problem, i.e. solaredge reporting system could not communicate properly with Mass energy reporting system, i just felt helpless and sent an email to Mr. Silverstre, who took over the responsibility and solved the problem single handedly.

The main electrician from United Solar, forgiving me not being able to recall his name now, is a very respectable professional. It was such a pleasure being able to talk with this guy who constantly offered me a lot of solar energy and electric tips.

3358,3368,20701,"Marco our salesman was knowledgeable and explained the system very thoroughly and easy to learn. We looked at financial together, and it became obvious that I could save money every month by going solar. I've used the PAC program, which meant I did not have to pay any money upfront which was a huge plus. Alexis was persistent and always followed up with me. When I had questions, about the project she was happy to answer them, really friendly. Installation was fast and easy. They did a great job installing the solar panels, they look great on the roof.

Matt answered all my questions during the sales process and really helped me determine how solar would truly benefit me and my home. The time from signing my contract to the installation was very quick. I got quotes from several other companies, but Liv Solar was the only one to take the time to really explain the entire process from start to finish. 

One of my favorite things was being able to get in contact with one person who could answer all my questions and concerns. I wasn’t having to talk to numerous people during the process. Having one point of contact and great customer service was very important to me.

3370,3380,21817,"One of the great things about working with Energy Sage is getting a lot of quotes from a lot of different companies. One of the bad things about working with Energy Sage is getting a lot of quotes from a lot of different companies.

We met so many outstanding business owners and Solar Professionals and Silas was one of them. He spent hours discussing his quote with us answering all of our questions and discussing several options for our PV system.

We had a very difficult time narrowing down which company to choose for our Solar installation provider. I mean it was really hard and if I could have, we would awarded the job to both of the final two companies we considered. 

We had a total of 7 quotes and met personally with 4 of the 7 companies. From the beginning Silas was one of our favorites. He was very knowledgeable, professional and most of all honest.

There were several occasions where we thought we needed more equipment or options that just wouldn't have helped us achieve our goals. Silas was gentle and honest in explaining why a particular option wouldn't yield the benefit we thought it might. 

We really appreciated that sort of honesty as he could have told us what we wanted to hear and taken advantage of us. That honesty is why I'm making a point to write up this review.

From the beginning it was clear he was looking to provide a system that would maximize our investment while making sure we were satisfied with his explanation. 

I'm sad to say we didn't select SuperGreen Solutions in the end to install our system but it wasn't because of anything he did or didn't do. Even after we chose another company to install our system, Silas followed up with us to make sure all our questions had been answered and offered to assist if we needed his help after our system was installed. 

How awesome is that sort of attitude? 

If you have the opportunity to work with Silas, I can only say that you'll understand why I'm writing this review even though we selected a different provider for our Solar PV system installation.

I did not rate Quality or Service below because we didn't work with Silas to install our system. The Value of his proposal and the responsiveness of his company to our questions and concerns merits a five star review!",5,0.8176

3372,3382,22843,"I found Zayith Pinto and Evergreen Solar excellent to work with.  Zayith answered all my questions and provided the best value for the Panasonic PV system.  Zayith did not try to over-sell a larger system then could be installed for the most efficient production on my roof and he  was honest about the production that could be obtained with the most efficient design - ending with 39 panels,  I needed a large system and had a previous non-EnergySage quote for a 48 panel system that had panels placed where the output would help to reach 100% of my usage but with many panel placed in locations were not optimal - increasing cost without a proportional power increase.  Other quotes promised more at less cost but, but didn't seem to provide the value of Evergreen Solar's quote.
 
 Evergreens installers finished the project in a bit over one day and did a clean good looking installation.  The crew was courteous and cleaned up after themselves, including fixing roof tiles that were already broken prior to the project.  It only took a few weeks to get the project installed once the contract was signed.   Evergreen Solar has as a very good installation warranty - better than most others - comprehensive fix or replace for 25-years; where many companies only provide the manufacturer's hardware warranties.  A great job and good value overall.",5,0.8555
3373,3383,20021,"This vendor operates differently than the others.  They didn't post a quote, just a message that they were working on it.  When the quote was not forthcoming, I sent them a reminder that I was interested.  They responded and set an appointment.  The salesman arrived and showed me a quote on his laptop.  I asked him to provide me a quote via email or paper so that I could compare it with the others that I had received.  He refused.  He wanted me to sign with them on the spot.  He asked me about the other vendors and wanted to see their quotes.  I told him that I didn't think that was fair.  Then, he gave me a spiel about how his company was the best and kind of trashed the others.  I answered that I would not sign that day, but if he would give me the quote, I would review it alongside the others and make my decision.  He asked me if we were done.  I told him we were.  So he left.  He has yet to send me a quote or post it on the EnergySage website.  I've seen some good reviews about them.  It makes me wonder what they are hiding if they won't turn over their quote for comparison.",2,-0.296

3375,3385,22735,"What impresses me with a business is if they keep their commitments, accept responsibility for providing quality equipment and labor, and inform/engage me along the way.  I expect going above & beyond. And  PINGO did...it is a ""High Reliability Organization.""!!

They know their business and how to manage their customers expectations while providing encouragement when other entities (such as the County or the power company) present unexpected slow downs.  They have effective professional ways to communicate with these other players when necessary. They actually came to the County and had two sets of plans, just in case the county wanted a different engineering plan just to save time.  They were ready and prepared!  I had to learn to let THEM handle the County & SDGE.

When I first started the transition to solar, I had many questions and concerns. I researched through Consumer Reports and found EnergySage.  I asked questions concerning the wind velocity guarantee for the panel roof mounts: they sent me the specs along with the County criteria which matched them.  Attention to detail!  

PINGO met the top criteria set forth by Consumer Reports. At first, I thought their quick response to send a drone team out to evaluate my roof to provide a quote a bit ""gimmicky"" at first....but was I so wrong!! It was merely a taste of their quick and professional work.  Bigger companies were slow to respond & their ""mock up maps"" of where they would put the panels were mediocre and not individualized to our unique manufactured home's needs. Our house is 3600 square feet with many ""gables"" because it is manufactured.

In spite of SDG&E's erroneous guidance concerning county inspection timing, PINGO made the project happen within amazing efficiency and with time to spare.  We decided on Friday evening 3/2/18 to go with PINGO.  We texted & emailed late into that evening concerning final questions & by Saturday, 3/3 we had a contract to sign & we were on the PINGO Path to Solar!!  Because of a deadline we had and PINGO's willingness to make it happen ""if at all possible,"" 24 days later, we were LIVE!! Absolutely amazing. KUDOS PINGO!

Personally, the timeliness & quality of their answers as well as the professionalism of their project manager Mark, & Scott, ""the man in the trenches,"" exceeded my expectations.  They were flexible and no question was considered superfluous. 

Because we contacted PINGO through EnergySage, PINGO extended the warranty on the inverter was extended to 25 years from 12 years and their workmanship warranty equals the panel warranty.  

I cannot recommend PINGO highly enough!  Thank you Scott, Mark & Alex (who answered so many of my initial emails / texts).",5,0.7351

The installers were all great, the electricians were informative and listened to my needs prior to moving forward. Any problem was addressed more then adequately.

The owner, Khaled is an electrical engineer. He is extremely knowledgeable, experienced and easy to work with. His team was fast, efficient and thorough.  In addition to installing the system, they processed all the paperwork with the electric company, scheduled and completed all the inspections and did an outstanding job of trouble shooting all the little issues that can happen with a new system until everything was functioning smoothing.
