We transformed $\text{Installer\_Activity}$ and $\text{Market\_Transaction}$ into their natural logarithm. Natural log transformation on continuous dependent variable is a commonly used technique that is embraced by similar work such as \citep{tan2019you}. The distribution of the $\text{Installer\_Activity}$ and $\text{Market\_Transaction}$ are right-skewed with a skewness of $6.9$ and $6.1$ respectively. We transform the data to better conform to normality in order to improve the validity of inference.  As a robustness check, we performed analysis without log transformation and the results are consistent.
